    <div>Transcriber Notes</div>
  </div>
</div>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>Obvious typos corrected. Inconsistencies in punctuation kept as in original.
    </li>
    <li>Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation made consistent, e.g.: handbook, shipboard,
    to-day, chargé(s) d’affaires.
    </li>
    <li>Spelling of Quebec and Colombia made consistent, but otherwise spellings of city  and
    country names left as printed in the original.
    </li>
    <li>Unclear name suffix in the original was confirmed as Jacob Meyer Jr. elsewhere.
    </li>
    <li>Page number in Table of Contents for Lecture III—Consular Service—Duties changed to
    83 to match actual start of chapter.
    </li>
    <li>The Diplomatic Service and Consular Service tables in the Appendix have footnotes
    that are referenced in multiple entries across the original pages in the text. Rather
    than retain multiple footnotes with identical content, multiple anchors in the text may
    refer to a single note.
    </li>
    <li>P. 208 in the original indicates a footnote * that has no corresponding anchor on
    that page, so it does not appear here.
    </li>
    <li>The column headers with vertical text in the Synopsis of Commercial Treaties table
    on pp. 212-213 have been moved to a Key.
    </li>
    <li>The Synopsis of Commercial Treaties table uses Unicode characters dagger (U+2020) and
     double dagger (U+2021). If the device font does not support these characters, † and ‡,
    they may not appear correctly.
    </li>
    <li>Indent of Lethbridge, Alberta in table on p. 226 made to match surrounding entries
    since it falls in alphabetical order of those.
    </li>
    <li>If the device allows, some full page images can be clicked on to view a larger
    version.
    </li>

  <h2 class='c004'>The Professor Has An Idea.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c007'>It is the opinion of Professor Loyal of the
University of ---- that the average
American, to put it bluntly, knows little or
nothing about Uncle Sam’s foreign service.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is also of the opinion that the time is
at hand when the aforesaid average American
<em>must</em> know more about it, owing to the growth
in importance of our foreign relations, both
politically and commercially.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now if the good Professor could only work
miracles he would take the dry details which
he has in mind upon this subject, and make
them as interesting as fiction. Instead, however,
he chose a method to which he was more
accustomed, the “university extension” plan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>aiming primarily to stimulate interest in his
subject, and secondarily, in some small measure
to gratify it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reader is indebted to the notes of a
shorthand reporter who happened to hear the
entire course, both for the text here given
and for the illustrations with which it is
adorned. If he thinks that the latter are not
always in harmony with the text he must
remember that the Professor and the Scribe
did not see things from the same standpoint.
Moreover he must not hold the Professor too
strictly to account for his language, for it is
not to be wondered at if he occasionally forgets
himself and uses large words, which
might be considered out of place in a popular
lecture; and again, in his effort to impart life
and present-day interest to his subject he at
times introduces a levity which he hopes will
not too seriously offend the sober-minded, or
make them distrust his statements of fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the evening of the first lecture the
speaker, having been presented with the usual
complimentary remarks, first spoke briefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in explanation of the nature of the course
and of such courses in general. He mentioned
among other matters that syllabi or
leaflets containing outlines of the lectures,
together with copies of the “Diplomatic and
Consular Register,” would be distributed to all
in attendance. He also announced that opportunity
would be given at the close of each
lecture for questions from the audience, and
he promised to attempt to answer the same.
Then he turned to the subject of the evening.</p>

upon this or that question?</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a query you often hear, and perhaps
you stop to wonder how it is when the collective
opinion of any one country cannot be
known in a short time, that there can be such
a thing as a German attitude, an English or an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>American attitude, or who has a right to determine
upon this or that as our attitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, it is evident that in domestic affairs,
that is to say in national affairs, we as a people
can take time to deliberate and choose
our path; and it is just as evident that in
international affairs we cannot always do so.
“It is the unexpected that happens”, and we
must have some means of meeting emergencies
that will not wait. Hence a free people
is least free, theoretically, when it has to do
with the claims of treaties and international
law, for it cannot take time to consider and
decide upon all the facts; nay, even legislatures
may interfere seriously with the proper
discharge of such duties; so that in actual
practice, even the most democratic nations
have found it best to entrust the management
of foreign affairs, or in other words, the preservation
of their national equilibrium, to a
Premier, Chancellor or Foreign Secretary,
who is generally the ablest statesman that the
country can afford.</p>

<p class='c008'>This officer, with slightly differing functions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>is known in our country as the Secretary of
State, and he presides over the State Department.
Probably there is no office under our
Constitution that requires greater sagacity,
greater breadth of intellectual grasp and practical
training than this one of Secretary of
State, and the fact that it has been held by
such men as Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall,
James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy
Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C.
Calhoun, William H. Seward and James G.
Blaine is sufficient evidence of its importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was intended at first that the cabinet
officers should be as nearly equal as possible,
and the salaries were fixed and remain the
same to this day; but in the nature of the
case they could not remain of equal importance,
for the Department of State is more
intimately associated with the President than
any other. Washington would not allow foreign
ministers to address him—they must
reach him properly through the State Department,—hence,
if for no other reason, it is easy
to see how the Secretary of State assumed an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>official dignity that does not belong to the
other cabinet officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us see how he stands related to the
general government. Suppose we assume the
attitude of an intelligent foreigner, looking at
the “Great Republic” from the outside, and
trying to discover into whose hands the logical
working out of the Constitution has placed
the real power.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been said<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that we will at length discover
that in all ordinary times of peace the
government is practically in the hands of six
men, namely,—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>the President and two men whom he appoints—
    </li>
    <li>the Secretary of State, and
    </li>
    <li>the Secretary of the Treasury;
    </li>
    <li>the Speaker and two men whom he appoints—
    </li>
    <li>the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and
    </li>
    <li>the Chairman of the Committee of Appropriations.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Of these six, one-half are concerned with
the finances of the government; and of the
other half, one is the Chief Executive, another
may be called the chief legislative factor,
while the third is our official representative to
the rest of the world. This practical division
of the functions of government does not seem
to agree very well with the more theoretical
division into legislative, executive and judicial.
In other words, finance has assumed an
importance it was not intended to have, just
as was observed concerning the Secretary of
State.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>It may seem rather strange to speak of one
of our officials as the chief <em>social</em> functionary
in our governmental machinery, but we
have such a one, and he is no other than
the Secretary of State. The office of functionary
host for the government might be supposed
to belong naturally to the President,
who is spared this duty, however, owing to
the multiplicity of others that are unavoidable.
Consequently the Secretary of State, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the breadth of the field of his operations,
bringing him into touch with representatives
of other nations as well as the principal statesmen
of our own, and because, moreover, diplomacy’s
natural atmosphere has always
been that of society, must “keep open house”,
as it were, for the Republic. This alone would
be a sufficient burden for any one man, but
it is expected that the Assistant Secretaries of
State shall share it with him. Thus our Secretary
maintains the only semblance of a court
that will be tolerated by our “fierce democracie”,
and even for this we do not contribute
a cent of support, though around it and
through it operate vast interests, both national
and international. It is a manifest injustice to
these officials that we do not provide for such
legitimate expenses as must necessarily occur
on these semi-official, semi-social occasions.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>Now let us see what is the scope of the State
Department, for it is much more than a foreign
office, though that is its principle function.
It embraces the duties which in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>countries are given to the Keeper of the Seal,
the Minister of Justice, etc., such as—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>(1) keeping, promulgating and publishing the laws,
    </li>
    <li>(2) custody of the Great Seal,
    </li>
    <li>(3) preservation of the Government Archives, and
    </li>
    <li>(4) charge of all official relations between the general Government and the several
    States.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>Its scope is more particularly indicated by
the bureaus into which it is divided, namely,—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>the Bureau of Indexes and Archives;
    </li>
    <li>the Bureau of Accounts of the State Department;
    </li>
    <li>the Bureau of Rolls and Library;
    </li>
    <li>the Bureau of Appointments;
    </li>
    <li>the Bureau of Statistics, or Foreign Commerce;
    </li>
    <li>the Consular Bureau;
    </li>
    <li>the Diplomatic Bureau.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>Each of these bureaus is presided over by
a chief, and at the head of them all is the chief
clerk, who is “the executive officer of the Department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of State under the direction of the
Secretary.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Bureau of Indexes and Archives is a
sort of postoffice and recorder’s office combined,
for it receives the incoming mail, opens
it and classifies it as either diplomatic, consular
or miscellaneous, then indexes it so that
if necessary it can be readily traced, and then
turns over to the Chief Clerk the diplomatic
correspondence and the more important consular
and miscellaneous correspondence. This
the Chief Clerk reads, and the most important
is submitted to the Assistant Secretaries of
State, while the remainder is turned over to
the various bureaus for their attention. Likewise
after the Secretary and his Assistants
have signified the replies which are to be
made to the most important of the mail and
have examined and signed the same, it is collected
from all the bureaus, and the out-going
mail is indexed in another set of books.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Bureau of Accounts of the State Department
classifies its business as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>(1) International indemnities, or trust funds.
If you are an American citizen living abroad
and suffer a loss of property unlawfully, you
may expect the loss to be made good through
this Bureau of Accounts; that is unless you
happen to be a missionary, for Uncle Sam
doesn’t always extend, or try to extend, to
missionaries the same protection that is enjoyed
by other citizens living abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Diplomatic and consular accounts, i. e.,
the salaries paid to these officers, together
with all expenses incidental to the service.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) Accounts of the Department proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>(4) Passports. If you wish to secure passports
before going abroad, it must be done
through the State Department, as they are
issued nowhere else in the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>The telegraphic correspondence of the State
Department, mostly in cipher, is conducted by
this bureau.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Bureau of Rolls and Library has the
custody of the laws and treaties of the United
States, together with the Revolutionary archives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>etc. Its chief business is the “publication
of the laws, treaties, proclamations and
executive orders, work which must be performed
with the utmost attainable promptness,
speed and accuracy”, and its busy time is just
after the adjournment of Congress. It is this
Bureau that is honored with the custody of
the original draft of the Declaration of Independence,
the Articles of Confederation and
the Constitution of the United States. It also
has charge of the following:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>The records and papers of the Continental Congress,
    </li>
    <li>The Washington papers,
    </li>
    <li>The Madison papers,
    </li>
    <li>The Jefferson papers,
    </li>
    <li>The Hamilton papers,
    </li>
    <li>The Monroe papers,
    </li>
    <li>The Franklin papers,
    </li>
    <li>The papers of the Quartermaster General’s Department during the Revolutionary period.
    </li>
  </ul>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Bureau of Appointments receives applications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and recommendations for office.
It issues commissions, exequaturs and warrants
of extradition—terms to be explained in
connection with the consular service.</p>

<p class='c008'>It also has charge of the Great Seal of the
United States, a symbol of authority which
has been carefully guarded by one faithful
man for nearly fifty-three years.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Bureau of Statistics, or of Foreign
Commerce as it is now called, takes charge of
the data gathered all over the world by the
consular service. Whatever is of immediate
importance is published without delay in the
“Advance Sheets” of the Consular Reports,
and these are distributed to boards of trade,
the press and elsewhere. This prompt distribution
of valuable information was begun
in January, 1898, and since that time the
American system of Consular Reports is freely
acknowledged the best in the world.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The Consular Bureau is charged with correspondence
with the consular service. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>variety of this correspondence cannot be
guessed by those unfamiliar with the Consular
Reports, but its extent may be inferred from
the fact that out of 1,000 officers in this service,
perhaps half of them correspond with the Department.
In addition to the above, this
bureau has much to do by way of interview
with consular officers coming and going.
Moreover, this bureau has charge of examinations
of applicants, and after a candidate is
appointed it furnishes the particular instructions
for the position in view. This Bureau
must keep itself informed as to the personnel
of the service, and must even send inspectors
to the various consulates and report thereupon.
“Recently”, we are told, “the Chief
of the Bureau personally visited over one hundred
consulates in Cuba, Mexico, Canada,
Europe, India, China, and Japan”.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>Last and most important of all, politically,
is the Diplomatic Bureau. Its dealings are
with our own diplomatic officials at foreign
capitals, and with foreign diplomats at Washington.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>It is chiefly concerned, as we are
told, with the “examination, consideration and
discussion of diplomatic subjects, such as
treaties, claims, questions of international law,
and policy, etc.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So this last sentence is the only tantalizing
peep we are allowed to have within the sanctuary
of the State Department. This Bureau
with which the Secretary and his three Assistants
are chiefly concerned shares its secrets
with very few. The expediency of observing
secrecy in international politics was noticed
before; but there is another side to the question
which most of us see and perhaps some
of us talk about, and that is the point in negotiations
at which the government may take
the public into its confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the public feels, and has a right to feel,
that it has a proprietary interest in public
affairs. More than this, it is in an unhealthy
state when it doesn’t feel such an interest.
The public, at least the enlightened public,
knows that secrecy is apt to be troublesome
anywhere, especially in government. It knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of many a historic instance of corruption fostered
by secrecy, of intrigue, cabal, plot and
counterplot, until the whole fabric of the state
became vitiated. The public,—that is, the
American public,—may have some reason to
dread secrecy in local government, for many
an alderman wants nothing better than to be
let alone, and many a “convention boss” with
a few “ring” associates would prefer to “fix
the ticket” without any inspection by the public
whom he expects in a few days to browbeat
into supporting it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Granting that we haven’t been watchful
enough as to local politics, how is it nationally?
How about the Department of State—for
that alone is the place where secrecy is
justifiable?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was said by an authority on American
diplomacy about fifteen years ago that “there
is scarcely a country, even Russia or Germany,
where so little is known by the public of the
negotiations carried on at any one time by
the Secretary of State”. What did this indicate?
the efficiency of our government as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>negotiating machine? Did it indicate an indifference
of our people to their welfare?
Well, however it may have been at that time,
it is certain that there has been a growing
and insistent demand during the present decade
that negotiations shall be revealed at the
earliest possible moment. Public opinion has
even been known to dictate foreign policy—nay,
more, to reverse it after it had once been
determined upon by the State Department, as
in the case of the notorious “Queen Lil”. Indeed,
this instance in our diplomatic history
shows very satisfactorily that no administration
can stand or ought to stand against the
overwhelming volume of enlightened public
opinion raised against an unpopular measure
or a distrusted service. The public is bound
to know whenever it can, and when it can not
it is bound to guess, and its guessing may be
more disturbing to foreign negotiations than
a knowledge of the facts. Thus, while it may
not always be able to determine the course of
negotiations, it is always in its power to seriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>affect them and ultimately to overthrow
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But such cases as that of the Hawaiian
queen are rare, and the American public fortunately
has seldom had reason to apprehend
that state affairs were being grossly mismanaged.
Perhaps, on the other hand, it has
needed at times to be cautioned against over-insistence
upon its right to news—a vulgar
itching for a sensational stimulant. Perhaps
it has needed the reminder that it “had its
say”, directly or indirectly, in the choice of
officers, and that having chosen them, it
should, as a rule, reserve criticism until election
time returns; for between an eternal
“nagging” of public officials and a profound
indifference to public affairs there isn’t much
to choose. The New England town-meeting
has often been justly commended for cultivating
an interest in public affairs; but, on
the other hand, it frequently sets up its select-men
merely to be targets of abuse. No nation
and no community can have, or deserves
to have, the best possible government when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>its officials are subjected to a perpetual cross
fire of criticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Secretary of State should have as free
a hand as possible in the great game of world
politics, for the state being a gigantic business
firm, must, like all such firms, keep its
business to itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has long been a standing objection to
federal governments such as ours that they
are “weak in the conduct of foreign affairs”,
the imputation being that they are weak because
the Secretary of State lacks the initiative
afforded by a more centralized government.
But, as a matter of fact, the same official
in England, France, Italy, or Spain, is
more likely to be called upon for the progress
of foreign negotiations than in our own
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Constitution does not grant the
Secretary, that is to say, the Executive, entire
freedom in foreign affairs, for it explicitly
states that “<em>the President shall have power, by
and with the consent and advice of the Senate</em>,
to make treaties ... to appoint ambassadors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>other public ministers and consuls,”
etc. However, this restraint is not always
irksome, and it may sometimes prove
salutary. It is always a measure of assurance
to the people that the administration will not
commit the government to an unwise policy;
and more than this, it is an assurance to a
power with which we may be dealing that the
result of the negotiations is not likely to be
repudiated by the people when the chief executive
is backed by the legislature.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Senate entrusts its diplomatic functions,
except in the ratification of treaties and
the approval of the appointments of ambassadors,
to its Committee on Foreign Affairs.
This Committee leaves the initiative in diplomacy
to the State Department, taking care,
nevertheless, to keep track of any negotiations
that may be pending. Whenever the
Senate wishes to know the progress of negotiations
it passes resolutions calling for them,
the Chief Clerk of the Department gets them
ready, and the Senate then meets in closed
session during their consideration. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>diplomatic business is fairly well guarded and
at the same time a reassuring degree of legislative
oversight is maintained. To be sure,
we hear more or less criticism of Senate control,
which in the nature of the case must
mean a sacrifice of expediency, yet it remains
to be seen whether or not our system is too
cumbersome for prompt, prudent and adroit
statesmanship when brought into closer rivalry
with Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>For there is no doubt that for good or for
ill we are entering upon a degree of activity
in world politics such as we have never known
heretofore. Consequently it becomes a matter
of the highest necessity that our whole
diplomatic machinery be in a condition to
afford the greatest utility. Diplomacy in
these modern times is said to be the art of
maintaining peace; but it sometimes implies
a rivalry, nevertheless, which is far from pacific.
We should remember, therefore, that
European diplomats have behind them the advantage
of many years of study of their great
problems from their own standpoint and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>judgment of men of the greatest sagacity
upon intricacies of long standing, and that
most of them have governments more centralized
than our own. It means a great deal
to be able to quote in support of a position the
weight of an authority like Metternich, Cavour,
Bismarck, Gortschakoff, Richelieu,
Grotius or Canning. But if anyone thinks
that America is putting herself in a fair way
to be worsted in this greatest of fields of intellectual
battle, let him read the history of
American diplomacy and let him study the
part she has recently played in the world
drama. If he thinks she is taking this greater
part without adequate prestige, let him but
observe the flattering attention she is now receiving,
the coquetry for her favor and the
dread of her rivalry to be observed in every
quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The State Department, therefore, may be
expected to meet its new obligation successfully,
provided it is allowed to act without
too much interruption by people or legislature,
and provided that the same wise discretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>is observed in the choice of its chief officer
that has usually been exercised.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>It may not be out of place to mention here
another provision which lies outside of the
province of the State Department but affects
its usefulness, nevertheless. A well-known
case which occurred in Louisiana a few years
ago, illustrates the point. A number of Italians,
members of a band called the Mafia, were
killed by a mob, and as a consequence loud
complaints came from the Italian people, and
many bitter criticisms were urged against a
government which must needs leave the administration
of justice for aliens within its borders
to any locality where prejudice was evidently
high. Our government could only
give assurances of a satisfactory settlement of
the matter; but it was humiliating to feel the
powerlessness of the United States to take the
administration of justice in a case involving
foreigners out of the hands of the State of
Louisiana and into its own. Such cases have
happened more than once in our history, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the fact that they are liable to occur at any
time is a standing menace to our peace, and
will be so until the proper legislation is
enacted. This is an acknowledged weakness
in our government, a source of annoyance and
humiliation to every patriotic American, and
of embarrassment to the State Department.
One cannot do better in view of such a defect
and our comparative indifference to it, than
to quote the warning comment of James
Bryce: “As it is, that which might prove to
a European nation a mortal disease is here
nothing worse than a teasing ailment. This
is why Americans submit, not merely patiently
but hopefully, to the defects of their
government. The vessel may not be any better
built or formed or rigged than are those
which carry the fortunes of the great nations
of Europe. She is certainly not better navigated.
But for the present at least,—it may
not always be so,—she sails upon a summer
sea.”</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>We have been considering the State Department
thus far with respect to its relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to the general government, its chief officer,
its division into the various bureaus and some
general remarks upon its most distinctive feature,
the Diplomatic Bureau. There remain
several minor topics to be briefly presented,
leaving until the next lecture the method of
choosing men for the consular and diplomatic
service, a subject which might profitably
be considered here.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Department has varied in its scope
somewhat from time to time, now enlarging
its domain as the country grew, and greater
needs developed, and now surrendering some
of its functions to other departments, mainly
the Department of the Interior. It was first
known before the outbreak of the Revolution
as the “Committee of Secret Correspondence”,
with Benjamin Franklin at its head.
Next it was known (1777) as the “Committee
for Foreign Affairs”, and its first Secretary,
Thomas Paine, was dismissed for making an
official matter public. Next (1789) it was
known as the Department for Foreign Affairs,
and finally as the Department of State,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>with Thomas Jefferson as the Secretary. The
Patent Office originated under this Department,
but in 1849, when the Department of
the Interior was organized, it was formally
transferred to that department. In the same
way the Census Bureau was transferred to
the Department of the Interior in 1850. Likewise,
until the organization of the Department
of the Interior, the affairs of the Territories
remained under the Department of State.</p>

<p class='c008'>One important functionary not mentioned
among the bureaus is the Solicitor. This officer
is detailed from the Department of Justice
to “examine claims by or against foreign governments”
and to advise upon points of international
law involved in treaties, protocols,
etc. The Solicitor is not subject, in the discharge
of his duties, to the direction of the
Attorney General.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the regular business of this department,
and in addition to the work of the
Diplomatic Service, there are a number of
bureaus and foreign commissions appointed
for purposes more or less temporary, many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of which require diplomatic ability of the
highest order and others technical skill and
knowledge. There are at present under commission
the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) Bureau of the American Republics,
with a Director, a Secretary, five translators,
an Editor of the Monthly Bulletin, a Chief
Clerk and a Chief of the Division of Information.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Intercontinental Railway Commission,
four members.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) United States and Mexican Water
Boundary Commission, three American and
three Mexican members.</p>

<p class='c008'>(4) Nicaragua Canal Commission, three
members.</p>

<p class='c008'>(5) Commission to the Paris Exposition
of 1900, three members.</p>

<p class='c008'>(6) Reciprocity Commission, a special
Commissioner, a Secretary, an Assistant Secretary
and a Messenger.</p>

<p class='c008'>(7) Consular Board of Examiners, under
Executive Order of Sept. 20, 1895, three
members.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>(8) Joint High Commission, six members
besides a Secretary and a Messenger.</p>

<p class='c008'>(9) International Tribunal of Egypt, three
members.</p>

<p class='c008'>(10) Dispatch Agents, three; at New
York, San Francisco and London, England,
respectively.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>Such, then, is the State Department to-day.
Is it likely to assume a greater importance in
the future? That may well be, for though
it may lose still other functions besides those
it has already parted with, there will always
remain the one characteristic class of business
known as foreign relations, and this seems
likely to increase in volume and interest. It
is possible that it may yet become the department
through which the influence of the Executive
shall reach the dependencies, when
the necessity for military occupation shall
have gone by.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, before throwing the subject open for
discussion, I wish to refer you for further information
to the publications with which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>State Department has kindly furnished me
and from which I have gathered most of the
data that I have given you. Among the most
interesting and instructive of its publications
are the “Historical Papers”, previously mentioned,
its works on “international law, diplomacy,
and the laws of foreign nations”, the
“Consular Regulations”, “Consular Reports”
and various editions of “State Papers”, “Messages
and Documents” and the “Report of the
Committee on the Conduct of Business in the
Executive Departments”. The subject is now
open for question or discussion.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>After some moments’ silence the Professor
remarked—“I should have said at
the proper time that there is a House Committee
for Foreign Affairs, as well as a Senate
Committee. However, it has no diplomatic
functions—it merely serves as an auditing
committee.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Q. “How much does the Secretary of
State get a year?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “$8,000. It was once raised to $10,000
and the very next year it was reduced to
$8,000.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “And on that salary he ‘keeps open
house’, as you say, for the Republic?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Humph!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Professor”, said a wise-looking man
near the platform, “I suppose you think it is
good policy to stick to our traditional simplicity?
What’s the use of so much entertaining?
Is that a necessary part of government?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well”, said the Professor, “I would say
that our traditional simplicity is all right as
an ideal, provided we don’t make a religion
out of it. Hospitality is also a good ideal to
keep before the people,—international courtesy,
if you please,—and perhaps there is as
much virtue in the one as in the other. At
any rate, if there were no other reason, no
self-respecting nation would allow its representatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>abroad to receive every courtesy
and not make an equal endeavor to return the
courtesy. Now, entertaining costs money,
and there is no government appropriation for
any such purpose, thanks to our democratic
ideals, and as was shown before, the burden
of it falls on the Secretary of State, which is
unjust; for it is well known that the salaries
we pay our national officers are ridiculously
small when compared with those of other nations.
Some measures should be taken, apparently,
to meet this legitimate expenditure.
Have I answered your question?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but I think just the same as I did before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Professor,” said another man, “you have
spoken of the Secretary of State as if he were
responsible for our foreign policy; but do you
not mean that the President is responsible?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Secretary is responsible to the President
and the President to the people”, said the
Professor; “that is to say, the Secretary is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>responsible potentially and the President officially.
If they were to differ in opinion, why,
of course, that of the President would prevail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you not think that our Secretary of
State should be elected by Congress, in some
such way as the Premier and Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs is elected in England?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not by any means. Foreign affairs belong
essentially to the executive, not the legislative
branch of government. France, in my
opinion, is particularly unfortunate in that its
Foreign Secretary is chosen by the President
and the Premier, but is responsible to the
legislature. In Germany, according to the
constitution, ‘the Emperor represents the
Empire internationally’. He can even ‘declare
war if it is defensive, make peace, enter
into treaties with other nations, and appoint
and receive ambassadors’. Hence, you see,
as between Germany and the rest of the world,
the Kaiser can almost say, ‘I am the State’;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>which, if the Kaiser is infallible, is a very fine
thing. But to return to your question, it is
not quite exact to say that in Great Britain
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is
elected by and responsible to Parliament. He
is not always the Premier as he is at present;
besides, you must remember that with us the
Cabinet is an advisory board to the executive,
while in Great Britain, the Cabinet virtually
<em>is</em> the executive. Hence, no good analogy
can be drawn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do I understand, Professor, that in your
opinion, our system compares favorably with
the corresponding systems of other countries?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is certainly my opinion. The Senate
oversight—the only feature that is severely
criticized—may at times be troublesome
and costly, but it is a valuable check and
can not be dispensed with safely. After all,
the great advantage enjoyed by American diplomacy
is that we are more able than any
other nation to act the part of the umpire, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>peacemaker. This follows not only from our
geographical position, but from the fact that
at the very beginning we were free to choose
advanced ethical positions because we were
not tied to precedents.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As there seemed to be no further questions,
the audience was dismissed.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c004'>LECTURE II <br /> THE CONSULAR SERVICE—OFFICERS.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c007'>I shall speak more particularly this
evening, said the Professor, upon facts
associated with the persons employed in the
consular service; the selection, preparation
and such other matter as may be of interest,
leaving the duties of the service until the next
lecture. Of course, this division is arbitrary,
and is adopted merely as a matter of convenience.
The data which I shall adduce may be
found for the most part in the “Consular Regulations”,
which anyone may purchase from
the Superintendent of Documents in Washington.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The Consular Service, as was said before,
makes a small army of about 1,000 men.
These men are chosen from all parts of the
United States (aside from the foreigners in
the service), and are sent to all parts of the
world. They are above all things else, agents
of trade—messengers of commerce. Yet they
stand in so many relations to our government
and people that it is doubtful if any other position
in our modern civilization calls into service
a greater versatility—a wider exercise of
intellectual capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall consider the method by which
these officers are chosen, then some reforms
in that method which should have been
adopted long ago, and which, it is hoped, we
shall soon see in operation. But before describing
these methods and reforms, let us notice
briefly the <em>grade</em>, <em>rank</em> and <em>classification</em> of
the service, likewise the definition of a few
technical terms, in order that we may know
exactly what we are talking about.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>There are three principal grades in the consular
service, namely:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>(1) Consul General.
    </li>
    <li>(2) Consul.
    </li>
    <li>(3) Commercial Agent.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>These three are “full, principal and permanent
consular officers as distinguished from
subordinates and substitutes”. These latter
include Vice Consuls General, Deputy Consuls
General, Vice Consuls, Deputy Consuls,
Vice Commercial Agents, Consular Agents,
Consular Clerks, Interpreters, Marshals and
Clerks at Consulate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The term consul, as applied to the second
grade, has also a common, generic meaning,
including every consular officer, and it is in
the latter sense that we shall generally use it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same way the word consulate seems
to waver in meaning, sometimes covering the
entire region over which a consul has jurisdiction,
i. e., the consular district, and sometimes
implying only the official residence—the
room or building in which the consul does
business. The boundaries of the consulate—using
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the term in its broadest sense—are prescribed
by the President, and are usually defined
in the consul’s commission. The general
rule is that all places nearer to the official
residence than to any other consulate within
the same country are to be included in a consulate
just forming. These boundaries in
most cases have long since been determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now as to the difference in power between
these three principal grades there is little to
say, for there is very little difference except
that of grade. Their functions as consuls are
quite the same. The only difference is that
the Consul General, except in three cases, Calcutta,
Dresden and Mexico, has limited supervision
over consuls within his jurisdiction.
This supervision is confined to such as “can
be exercised by correspondence” and is intended
to insure that the Consular Regulations
are complied with and the Consular Reports
prepared for the State Department. The Consuls
General are “in no sense auditing officers”.</p>

<p class='c008'>A Consulate General usually includes all the
consulates within any one country, though in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>a large or important country there may be
several consulates general. In some cases
also there are no Consuls General whatever,
and the Consuls are then subordinated to the
Diplomatic Service.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Commercial Agent is simply a consul
of a lower grade and under another name.
The title is quite unfortunately chosen, especially
since the same term is used in other
countries to designate an officer quite inferior
in rank and privileges.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to subordinate officers and substitutes,
a word may be said in passing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vice Consuls General, Vice Consuls and
Vice Commercial Agents are just what might
be inferred from their titles—appointees to
take the place of their principals whenever the
latter are absent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The deputy officers, on the other hand, may
discharge the duties of their superiors while
the latter are at their posts, though they may
never “assume the responsible charge of the
office”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consular Agents represent their principals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in places throughout the consulate where the
latter do not reside; but their functions are
limited. In certain cases citizens of the country
may be appointed to this office.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to Consular Clerks, the President is
authorized to appoint as many as thirteen who
may be assigned to duty as the Secretary of
State may choose. They may not be removed
from office “except for cause, stated in writing,
which shall be submitted to Congress”.
This is a peculiar freak of legislation, but it
has some valuable suggestions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Interpreters are stationed only at certain
consulates in China, Japan, Korea, the Turkish
domains, and Zanzibar. They are usually
natives of the country. Marshals are appointed
only for certain consular courts in the less
civilized countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly Clerks at Consulates are such as attend
to the routine clerical work of the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all these subordinate positions it is
recommended that American citizens be employed
whenever possible.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>RANK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Since a consular officer generally holds office
such a short time, one would not expect
him to rank with Navy and Army officers, but
such is the case. Here are the equivalents in
rank:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>Consuls General
      <ul  class='ul_3'>
        <li>rank with
        </li>
        <li>Commodores in the Navy or
        </li>
        <li>Brigadier Generals in the Army.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Consuls and
    </li>
    <li>Commercial Agents
      <ul  class='ul_3'>
        <li>rank with
        </li>
        <li>Captains in the Navy or
        </li>
        <li>Colonels in the Army.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Vice Consular officers,
    </li>
    <li>Deputy Consular officers,
    </li>
    <li>Consular Clerks and
    </li>
    <li>Consular Agents
      <ul  class='ul_3'>
        <li>rank with
        </li>
        <li>Lieutenants in the Navy or
        </li>
        <li>Captains in the Army.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>It is an event of some consequence when
a United States naval squadron, or even a
lone cruiser, enters a foreign port where an
American consular officer is stationed; for the
time to “put on airs” and “show off”, if you
ever do such things, is when you are away
from home. On such an occasion a commander
of a squadron sends an officer ashore
to visit the consular officer and to invite him
on board the flag-ship. Or, in case it is but
a single war-vessel, the commander thereof
first goes ashore, visits the consul and invites
him on board. In either case the consul accepts
the invitation, as in duty bound, goes
on board and “tenders his official services to
the commander”. Usually upon his return to
the shore a salute is fired in his honor—nine
guns if a consul general, seven if a consul or
five if a commercial agent. While it is being
fired he faces the vessel and at the end of the
salute lifts his hat in token of acknowledgment
and the formalities are over.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consular officers are expected to advance
the interests of the Navy socially and otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>whenever they can do so without expense
to the Government. One cannot but
smile at the frequency with which these words
or their equivalent occur throughout the
“Regulations”.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Thus far we have considered the grade and
the rank of consular officers. Turning now to
classification, we find that it is merely a matter
of convenience to the State Department—an
arrangement according to salary. Again there
are three classes, or schedules, namely:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) Schedule B. This includes 38 consuls
general, 196 consuls and 10 commercial
agents. It embraces all those who “receive a
fixed salary and are not allowed to transact
(private) business”. These, of course, occupy
the more responsible positions and receive the
highest salaries, ranging from $5,000 down.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Schedule C. This includes only 10 consuls.
It embraces those who “receive a fixed
salary and are allowed to transact (private)
business”. The salaries of these ten consuls
are lower than those in the first schedule, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>they may make it up if they can by going into
business for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) The third schedule (which apparently
ought to be D), comprises all others who receive
no salary, but who are allowed to retain
the fees of their respective offices and to engage
in business. Of these there are 48 consuls
and 20 commercial agents.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF CONSULAR OFFICERS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The time has been when our consular service
was simply a plaything for politicians, and
the diplomatic service was not essentially different.
The improvement has been very slow
for the reason that it has been at the mercy
of Congress for the annual appropriation
which enables it to live, and to politicians
everywhere for the frequent changes in its personnel.
Or to go farther back for causes, its
improvement has been delayed because the
people have had more interest in the home
market than in the foreign market. When
our merchants send bales of advertising matter
printed in English to a country where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>English is unknown, what can you expect of
our people?</p>

<p class='c008'>But there has been some improvement; so
that notwithstanding the present weaknesses
of the system there are some reasons for congratulation
that it is as good as it is. There
was an executive order issued in September,
1895, which recognized the justice of some
of the complaints made against the service
and provided for some measures of reform.
Among these we notice that consulates or
commercial agencies paying between $1,000
and $2,500 per year shall be filled in one of
three ways—</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) “By transfer or promotion from some
other position under the Department of State
of a character tending to qualify the incumbent
for the position to be filled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This enables the Department to be something
of a training school for the service, in
a small way.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) “By appointment of some one not under
the Department of State, but having served
thereunder to its satisfaction in a capacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>tending to qualify him for the position to be
filled”.</p>

<p class='c008'>This gives second preference to those who
may have been discharged for political reasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) “By the appointment of a person who,
having furnished the customary evidence of
character, responsibility and capacity, and being
thereupon selected by the President for
examination, is found upon such examination
to be qualified for the position.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The order of preference given above seems
to be very judicious and thoroughly in harmony
with the spirit of civil service reform.
The President further stated that “a vacancy
in a consulate will be filled at discretion only
when a suitable appointment cannot be made
in any of the modes indicated”.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed, however, that this order
makes provision for filling only the less important
consular positions, that is, those paying
between $1,000 and $2,500 per annum.
As to the method of filling the others it is
silent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>In pursuance of this order the Secretary of
State added a list of the subjects to which the
examination should relate, namely—</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) General education, knowledge of languages,
business training and experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) The country in which the consul or commercial
agent is to reside, its government,
chief magistrate, geographical features, principal
cities, chief production and its commercial
intercourse and relations with the United
States.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) The exequatur, its nature and use.</p>

<p class='c008'>(4) Functions of a consul or commercial
agent as compared with those of a vice consul
or consular agent; relation of former to latter,
also to the United States minister or ambassador
at the capital of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>(5) Duties of a consul or commercial agent
as regards:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_4'>
    <li>(a) Correspondence with the State Department and the form thereof.
    </li>
    <li>(b) Passports, granting and visaing.
    </li>
    <li>(c) United States merchant vessels in a foreign port, and their crews, whether
    seeking discharge, deserting or destitute.
    </li>
    <li><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>(d) Wrecks within jurisdiction.
    </li>
    <li>(e) Wrongs to United States citizens within jurisdiction.
    </li>
    <li>(f) Invoices.
    </li>
    <li>(g) Official fees and accounts.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>(6) Treaties between the United States and
the foreign country.</p>

<p class='c008'>(7) Relation of ambassador and minister to
laws of the country to which they are accredited,
as compared with those of consul or commercial
agent to those of the countries where
they reside.</p>

<p class='c008'>(8) Acts of ambassador or minister, how far
binding upon his country.</p>

<p class='c008'>(9) Diplomatic, judicial, and commercial
functions of consuls or commercial agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>(10) Piracy, what it is and where punishable.</p>

<p class='c008'>(11) Consular Regulations of the United
States—copy of which (to be returned to the
Department) will be supplied to each candidate
upon application.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>(12) Such other subject or subjects as the
Board may deem important and appropriate
in any particular case.</p>

<p class='c008'>One might suppose that a man who could
pass a good examination on the above subjects
would be pretty well qualified for the
service, with one glaring exception, namely,
that nothing is said about <em>requiring</em> an acquaintance
with modern languages, especially
that of the country where the consul is to be
located.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moreover, complaints are still coming in as
before, so that, although it is somewhat the
fashion to condemn our consular system as
the “worst in the world”, it is evident that
we haven’t got to the bottom of the difficulty
yet.</p>

<p class='c008'>It needs no argument to show that the
“spoils system”, pure and simple, is the most
suicidal policy possible. The logic of history—our
own history—upon this very point, is
conclusive. But to throw the consular and
diplomatic service into the “classified list”,
or, in other words, to decide upon the fitness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of a candidate merely upon the merits of a
civil service examination would make but
small improvement. It would tinker the old
machine instead of replacing it with a new
one. Such a process may determine upon a
candidate’s preparation—if an examination
may be said to determine anything—but it can
not reach his personality—what he is,—nor
can it reveal his capacity for work—what he
can do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now these three points are to be considered
in determining a candidate’s fitness for any
position whatever—what he is, what he knows,
and what he can do. The practical problems
for the State Department are how to determine
what a man is when in the majority of
cases he is an entire stranger, how to discover
what he can do when he has never been tested
by experience, and how to expect him to
know much about the business when there is
not a school anywhere prepared to give the
needed instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suppose you want to prepare for this service,
how would you go about it? How would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>you find what was needed, what you should
study and where to look for it? The government
provides no means whatever of preparing
men for foreign service. They simply
get into it somehow—always, of course,
through political influence—and then learn it
necessarily at government expense. Just
about the time they have mastered the language
and are prepared to do their best work,
along comes a change of administration and
turns them out of office, and then the government
begins again the expensive task of training
a new set of men. This is not a hypothetical
case. It is the rule rather than the exception.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, what ought to be done?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why, establish some means of instruction
for one thing. No one will doubt the wisdom
of maintaining the academies at West Point
and Annapolis for the Army and Navy, and
are not the needs of the foreign service, Diplomatic,
Consular, and lately Colonial, as
urgent and important as the others? We have
often heard the need of a great national university
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>urged, and we occasionally hear a
timid plea for a national school at Washington
for the training of consuls and diplomats, but
it is gratifying to notice the declaration in
favor of the latter by such an eminent body
of educators as those university presidents
constituting the committee chosen by the
National Educational Association to consider
this very subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The need of a school of political science,
economics, and modern languages, and the
need of its location at the capital of the nation
and under national control, is all the more
urgent and unmistakable now that questions
in colonial government are coming up for
solution; and when one considers the multitude
of problems afforded by the work of the
consular service, together with the statecraft
of the diplomatic, it is easy to see that there
should be such an institution. A government
which has provided so liberally for general
education ought not to neglect that wise provision
where its own efficient service demands
it and nothing else can well supply it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>But the school cannot do it all, and its work
must be supplemented by experience—say a
year or more of residence for successful candidates
at a foreign consulate or legation. And
whenever a new man is appointed it should
evidently be to one of the lower positions,
leaving the higher ones to be filled by promotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is gratifying to notice that an honest and
intelligent effort is being made in Congress
to bring about some needed reforms in the
consular service. A bill<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> is before the present
House of Representatives which provides that
“appointments shall be made to grades and
not to specific places”. “A consul’s station”,
says one authority<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a> commenting upon the bill,
“should depend on the exigencies of the service,
and should not necessarily be permanent.
Good consuls may thus be obtained for undesirable
places, a thing which is now well nigh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>impossible”. “It provides also”, says the
same authority, that “removals shall not be
made by caprice or for other than specified
cause. To put a check upon appointments
only or removals only is to leave at either end
a loophole for evasion of the spirit of the reform.
By crowding one man in, another may
be crowded out”.</p>

<p class='c008'>One would be astonished that such common-sense
measures as these have not been in
operation this long time, were it not for the
power of “practical politics”. The “practical
politician” is discovered easily and in every
precinct. You have only to speak of efficiency
or merit as the chief test of a candidate’s
fitness for office, and he will have
something to say about “giving every man a
chance”, “changing around”, “getting out of
the ruts”, etc. Should a consul’s station depend
upon the “exigencies of the service”?
Certainly; what is the service for? May he
not be “removed by caprice”? Certainly not;
for again, what is the service for?</p>

<p class='c008'>Appointment to grades instead of to particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>positions allows a shifting of men from
one post to another whenever it is desirable,
and it does so without sacrificing valuable experience.
For it is true that a long residence
at one consulate may so familiarize a man with
his surroundings, especially if he finds himself
in a lucrative business, that he becomes in
some degree alienated from his own country
without being aware of it. He may lose track
of events at home or else become accustomed
to viewing them from a foreign standpoint,
so that as a result he falls into an apologetic
tone toward those who criticize or a critical
attitude toward the home government. He
is then in a fit condition to be sent home. It
has been suggested as a preventative to this
that consuls be recalled from time to time to
give lectures throughout the country, or instruction
in a school for the consular service.
Otherwise the same result will be accomplished
so far as the consul is concerned, by
shifting him to another position along with
some salutary advice as to what his business
is. This provision also puts the service more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>on a footing with the Army and Navy, which
in many respects would be a decided gain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since this bill or a similar one is likely to
become a law, and in any event has already
earned strong endorsement, I append a few
more of its provisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of consul general, consul and commercial
agent there are to be four grades,
namely consul general of the first and the
second class and consul of the first and the
second class.</p>

<p class='c008'>All consular officers shall receive compensation
in salaries—none in fees.</p>

<p class='c008'>Subjects in examination shall relate “chiefly
but not exclusively to the duties of the consular
service, and for consul of the first class
examination in one foreign language will be
required”.</p>

<p class='c008'>The President is to appoint a board of five
examiners, “who are to be the Civil Service
Commissioners and two officials of the State
Department”. These, however, shall have no
connection with the reorganization of the entire
service, which is entrusted to a committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>consisting of two Senators, three Representatives
and one officer of the State Department.
It is intended that this committee shall have
a pretty free hand in the inauguration of desirable
changes, and the President is given
large discretion as to the manner of putting
such changes into execution.</p>

<p class='c008'>There remains one important subject to be
mentioned—the very difficult subject of the
selection of men for examination, or after examination
it may be. The present system is
purely political. If you happen to have “influence”
which will secure you a recommendation
to the President you may be permitted
to take the examination whenever a vacancy
occurs. Hence the way is pretty effectually
barred as far as unsupported merit is concerned;
so it depends much more upon the
“influence” than upon your merit. This is
open to obvious abuses, and in case restrictions
as to preparation are set aside, what
have we but the “spoils system”?</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand the Department must
know something more about you than an examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>can show. It must have some assurance
of your powers of observation, your
business acumen, your vigilance and alertness,
and especially your dignity and integrity of
character, so that you may well represent
your country’s interests among foreigners,
and defend the international rights of your
fellow citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether any better way can be devised
remains to be seen, but in justice to the present
system it must be said that it has secured
many good officials—so many, indeed, that
the American consular system, according to
one writer<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, has become a subject of careful
study by European nations. The same writer
quotes from <cite>La Revue Diplomatique</cite> as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Americans are practical men and their
instinct for business is marvelous. Nothing
is more characteristic in this respect than the
organization of their consular corps. Its duty
is that of a sort of bureau of information at
the expense of the state. It is recruited principally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>from journalists, who carry into their
official career the trained instinct of observation,
the quick grasp of passing events which
belong to their former profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The American consul does not understand
that he has a commercial situation to maintain
but always a commercial situation to conquer.
His ingenuity is exercised to invent and find
new markets, and in his study of ways and
means, he descends to the most minute details.
Despite their colonial conquests, the
Americans have comprehended that the real
struggle remains in the old markets—that
there especially is the hard school that will
force them to manufacture and sell better than
all others”.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears from the above quotation, as well
as others, that, in the judgment of Europeans,
the peculiar excellence of the American consul
is analogous to that of the American soldier—his
ability to take the initiative, to be his
own commander.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all, the man is more important than
the equipment and harder to discover.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>AFTER APPOINTMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Now let us watch our candidate get ready
for business after he has received notice of his
appointment. Every consular officer before
entering upon his duties must take the prescribed
oath of office and give bond for a sum
of not less than one thousand nor more than
ten thousand dollars. Then his commission
is made out and given to the Diplomatic Bureau
along with a special passport and an
order on his predecessor to turn over the office
to him. The commission is forwarded to
the diplomatic representative in the country
where he is to be stationed with instructions
to procure from the government an exequatur.</p>

<p class='c008'>An exequatur, in a word, is <em>permission to
act</em>. It is simply a formal recognition of the
right of any country to grant or refuse to any
other country, or any of its representatives,
the right to do business within its territory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile our newly made consul is supposed
to be very hard at work completing his
preparation, for he is to be at his post within
thirty days of the date of his commission, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>salary having begun on the date of his taking
the oath of office. Having arrived at his post
he notifies the American legation of that fact
and receives his exequatur. Then he applies
to the person in charge of the consulate for the
government archives, the seal and all other
government property. In company with his
predecessor or the one in charge of the office,
he makes an inventory of all the effects, and
transmits a copy of it to the State Department.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is expected that the consulate shall remain
in the same place; but if our consul prefers
to move he may move. He must do so,
however, subject to instructions, for he is expected
to establish his office “at the most convenient,
central location that the sum allowed
for office rent will permit”, and then give in
minute detail a description of the new office
in a report to the State Department. “The
arms of the United States should be placed
over the entrance to the consulate, unless prohibited
by the laws of the country.” The flag
may be hoisted occasionally, on national holidays,
etc., if there is no objection, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>always hoisted when required for protection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing is stipulated as to his residence
except that it must be within the town in
which he is doing business. Though he is
expected to have regular office hours, he must
be willing to be at the service of the public if
called upon outside of those hours.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>PRIVILEGES.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The consular service originally comprised
some of the functions and enjoyed many of
the privileges of the diplomatic. It lost those
functions and most of the privileges when the
diplomatic service developed and became common,
except in uncivilized countries. The
consul has lost, in the main, his representative
character and has retained in uncivilized countries
his judicial power—capacity to act as a
judge. The consul has lost the right of exterritoriality,
that is, the right to be subject
to the laws of his own country and not to
those of the country where he is stationed.
However, he is under the special protection of
international law and is regarded as the officer
“both of the state which appoints and the state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>which receives him”. The extent of his authority
is derived from his commission and his
exequatur, and the extent of his privileges is
defined for the most part by treaties between
his own government and the one where he is
stationed. Among these we will notice the
following:</p>

<h3 class='c011'>TREATY RIGHTS.</h3>

<p class='c012'><em>The-most-favored-nation</em> clause in a commercial
or consular treaty between two powers
entitles the consuls of those two countries to
all the privileges that those countries grant to
the consuls of other powers. It is no more
than an agreement between Smith and Jones
that in a certain particular they will treat each
other as decently as they treat any of their
other neighbors.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Inviolability of the archives and papers</em> of the
consulate means that they cannot be seized or
examined by anybody.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Inviolability of the consular office and
dwelling</em> secures those places from invasion
even by officers of the law; but it is understood
that they are not to be used as an asylum or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>place of refuge for fugitives from the law. If
it is known that they are so used it is doubtful
if there are many countries where this would
hold.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Exemption from arrest</em> secures to a consul
the freedom of a diplomatic officer, but this
is seldom enjoyed in full. Usage inclines to
grant every liberty to a consul consistent with
public welfare. He is seldom exempt from arrest
for crime.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Exemption from obligation to appear as a
witness</em> “except for defense of persons accused
of crime” is secured in several countries.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Exemption from taxation</em> of personal property
is secured in a number of countries, provided
the officer is not a citizen of that country,
and provided also he is not engaged in
business.</p>

<p class='c008'>This first proviso may sound a little strange,
yet it is a fact that Uncle Sam has often jeopardized
his reputation for shrewdness by employing
citizens of a country to represent his
commercial interests right in their own home.
A study of treaties will show that foreign governments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>do not look upon this arrangement
with more favor than we should, hence it is
a good practice to abandon.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Exemption from military billetings and public
services</em> is granted upon the same proviso mentioned
above.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are not all the points covered by
treaties in reference to the consular service,
but the remainder contemplate his duties rather
than his privileges and may be mentioned,
possibly, in the next lecture. Bear in mind
that these privileges do not exist in any country
unless it is so stipulated in a treaty between
the United States and that particular country.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>PROHIBITIONS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Uncle Sam doesn’t propose to have his public
servants abroad intermeddling in foreign
politics. Consuls are desired to “cultivate
friendly social relations with the community
in which they reside”, but to “refrain from
expressing harsh or disagreeable opinions
upon local, political or other questions which
divide the community within their jurisdiction.
They are forbidden to participate in any manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>in the political concerns of the country.
In their (public) dispatches upon such subjects,
they will confine themselves to the communication
of important or interesting public
events as they occur, avoiding all unnecessary
reflections upon the character or conduct
of individuals or governments, and they will
not give publicity, through the press or otherwise,
to opinions injurious to the public institutions
of the country or the persons concerned
in their administration”.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is good, sound diplomacy; and the
same paragraph goes on to say, “It is at the
same time no less their duty to report freely
and seasonably to their own government all
important facts which may come to their
knowledge touching the political condition of
the country, especially if their communications
can be made to subserve or may affect the
interests of their own country”.</p>

<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/image080.jpg' alt='U.S. CONSUL' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Public Speeches.</span>—He is “not allowed to
allude in public speeches to any matters in dispute
between the United States and any other
government, nor to any matters pending in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the consulate. It is a still better rule to avoid
public speeches when it can be done without
exciting feeling”.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Press.</span>—The prohibitions extend also
to correspondence with the press, not literary
or non-political articles, but to such as touch
upon public affairs in any foreign government,
or communications to newspapers relative to
epidemic diseases abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Gifts, Testimonials.</span>—Consuls are not
permitted to ask or accept for themselves or
anybody else “any present, emolument, pecuniary
favor, office or title of any kind from
any foreign government”. If any such offers
are made to them “they may apply to Congress
through the Department of State for
permission to accept the same”.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Recommendations for Office.</span>—Consuls
are forbidden to recommend any one for any
governmental office or trust of profit. By permission
of the Secretary of State they may
make recommendations to offices subject to
their own jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Uniform.</span>—Consular officers are forbidden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to wear any distinguishing uniform. The
Regulations are indulgent enough to allow
them to wear an Army uniform if they happen
to have been in the Army of the United States
during the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Absence.</span>—Consuls are forbidden to be absent
from their posts longer than forty-eight
hours without reporting to the Department
about it. No one is permitted to be absent
more than ten days at any one time without
permission from the President. Special permission
must be obtained in order to return
to the United States, and the statutes do not
provide for a continuance of salary for an absence
of longer than sixty days.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is about all that need be said about
the consuls themselves. What remains to be
considered will come up in connection with
the duties of the consular office. We will wait
a few moments for questions.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>Q. “Professor, aren’t there other needed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>reforms in the consular service besides those
you have mentioned”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Certainly, but I preferred to dwell only
upon the most difficult and at the same time
the most vital of them all; namely, the choice
and preparation of the men. I think it might
be well to emphasize just a point or two more
in this connection. The first is that the consular
service ought not to be filled with foreigners.
The Consular Register of July, 1899,
shows that out of 706 subordinate positions,
including commercial agencies, 412 are filled
by men born in the country where they are
stationed. In fact, out of a total of 1,020 men
in the consular service only 547 are of American
birth or parentage. The reason for this
is that so many of the positions don’t pay
enough to induce Americans to undertake
them. Four or five hundred dollars a year
may mean something to a man who is on the
spot, small as the sum is, but it shuts Americans
out of a large majority of the subordinate
positions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The second point to be mentioned is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>effect of this parsimony—miscalled economy—upon
the higher positions. For instance, suppose
a man is appointed to a place, the duties
of which involve some diplomatic responsibility.
Such a man must live on a scale becoming
his position, or bring himself and his
country into contempt. As a matter of fact
it has frequently happened that a thrifty consul,
profiting by the example in frugality set
by his government, has tried to save money
by living in rented rooms above his business
office, only to find when the inspector came
around that he had to move out and live in a
more sumptuous fashion. Aside from the
question of sentiment, democratic or undemocratic,
the government is best served by a
consul who, other things being the same,
enters a great deal into society and is not too
careful to live within his income. It gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>him an influence, a prestige among his surroundings
which inures to the financial advantage
of his country. Uncle Sam pays less
for his consular service than does any other
power of equal wealth, but those who know
best the service and its possibilities have always
claimed that it is poor economy.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/image084.jpg' alt='Barking dog on a chain standing between man and money bag' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Will you please distinguish again between
Consular Clerks and Clerks at Consulate”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Certainly; Consular Clerks are not
stationed at consulates at all. They are specialists
who work upon some task assigned by
the State Department. Such a one may specialize
upon a certain line of textile fabrics in
all its degrees of quality and the methods
employed in its manufacture. Another may
become an expert authority on chemicals or
iron and steel products, etc. Clerks at Consulate
are, as you may suppose, those engaged
in ordinary clerical duties at the consulates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Do you think that the present movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in favor of consular reform has any partisan
purpose”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Not at all. The last two administrations,
i. e., Cleveland’s and McKinley’s, have
done more for this cause, perhaps, than all
the others put together. Moreover, the time
just now is ripe for this reform and Congressmen
should be more than ever awake to
the necessity of it, irrespective of party”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “How about that school for consuls and
diplomats, Professor? It seems to me that
however desirable it may be, it is hardly feasible
for partisan reasons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “That, of course, is the stock objection
to such a proposition. Yet I fail to see why
such a school might not be put into the hands
of a non-partisan board—say the second and
third Assistant Secretaries of State, who do
not change with the administration as a rule.
And we might add to these the Civil Service
Commissioners, or any other competent men,
provided they are not to be meddled with on
the score of partisanship. Partisanship does
not enter into the management of West Point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>or Annapolis to any noticeable extent, nor
does it prevent our numerous State universities
from being as well managed as other institutions
of learning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “But why not leave all this to the institutions
already established?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Well, perhaps as good a reason as any
is that none of them are in Washington. The
government has here its great scientific museum,
the Smithsonian Institute; also its historical
museum, various experiment stations,
and above all, perhaps, its Congressional Library
and collections of State papers and
archives. Besides, diplomacy should be
learned from diplomats in active service—men
acquainted with their occupation both past
and present, European and American. Such a
school need not be continuous, perhaps, or
conducted as many months of the year as
other schools, its chief purpose being to satisfy
the exigencies of the Government, rather
than to furnish a liberal education”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “I suppose, Professor, that our Government
has treaties with most other countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>covering the principal points of commercial
importance”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Yes, in the main, though there are
some surprising exceptions. For instance,
‘the-most-favored-nation’ clause is not in the
treaties with either Great Britain or Sweden
and Norway. With many of our neighboring
states we have no extradition treaties whatever.
A glance at the synopsis<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a> given will
show that our treaties are fullest with the following
named countries: Austria, Belgium,
Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Holland,
Roumania, San Salvador and Servia. Evidently
the treaties with some of the other
countries need overhauling.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c007'>Consular duties, like household
duties, are very numerous;
and about as multiform as they
are numerous. The mere mention of
them, aside from any description or
dwelling upon particulars, would
leave little time for anything else to
be said in the same lecture. We shall
content ourselves, therefore, with a cursory
view, a glance over the whole field of those
duties, without stopping to distinguish between
those of a consul and those of a consul
general, or of a seaport and of an inland town.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>The following classification will be found
to be helpful and very nearly comprehensive:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_5'>
    <li>(1) Duties commercial.
    </li>
    <li>(2) Duties in connection with customs regulations.
    </li>
    <li>(3) Duties to merchant vessels.
    </li>
    <li>(4) Duties in case of wrecks.
    </li>
    <li>(5) Duties to officers, naval, diplomatic and departmental.
    </li>
    <li>(6) Duties to seamen.
    </li>
    <li>(7) Duties in regard to immigration and quarantine.
    </li>
    <li>(8) Duties to citizens other than seamen.

    <li>(9) Duties judicial—in non-Christian countries.
    </li>
    <li>(10) Duties to the State Department.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>There are a few others, such as duties in
regard to extradition, the purchase and transference
of foreign built vessels, etc., etc., which
we shall term miscellaneous.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES COMMERCIAL.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The most important of these—the one indeed
which is now, as it always has been, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>central importance in the consular service, is
the one first mentioned—commercial duties.
Owing to its importance I will quote in full
from the Consular Regulations, pages 248-51,
the list of subjects upon which the consul is
expected to report to the State Department:</p>

<p class='c008'>“1. Conditions of foreign commerce and
internal trade, manufacturers, mechanical industries,
agriculture, etc., especially—</p>

<p class='c008'>“(a) Statistics of exports and imports, of
shipping and of revenue and expenditure of
the country; amount of public debts, national
and local; rates of taxation, character of taxable
basis, how taxation is levied and collected,
amount of taxation per capita, etc.; value,
actual value in exchange, and also as measured
by the dollar of the United States; changes
in purchasing power of the currency; banking—new
systems, especially of savings banks
and of banks as associations for lending money
to agriculturists, mechanics, and factory operatives;

<p class='c008'>This is an admirable list for any one to
study if he would learn what are the signs of
a nation’s material prosperity. It deserves
further comment because of its importance to
the consular service, but we must pass on.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CUSTOMS REGULATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>A large share of the routine of every consulate
is concerned with the customs regulations,
certifying to invoices, guarding against
fraud, keeping account of all transactions and
reporting the same to the State Department.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>If you are engaged in importing “fancy
Scotch cheviots” (your imported Scotch goods
are made in America, however), the goods
must be described in full in a consular invoice.
This invoice must be signed by yourself
or agent and accompanied by an “official
shipper’s certificate”, which amounts to saying
that the invoice is “all right”, and this again
must be signed by the shipper and certified by
the consul. Thus the consular service facilitates
the work of the customs officials by having
imported goods invoiced before arrival at
the “port of entry”.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES TO MERCHANT VESSELS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>An American merchant vessel sailing from
an American to a foreign port is required under
penalty to deposit its register and also its
sea letter with the American consul immediately
upon reaching its destination. “It is
usual also to deposit its crew list and shipping
articles”. These documents are known as the
“ship’s papers”, and are kept by the consul
until the ship has received “clearance”.</p>

<p class='c008'>The consul is required to give the masters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of vessels all information in his possession
concerning coast surveys, pilot and hydrographic
charts, etc., such as are published by
the Navy Department, and to furnish to the
State Department any information that may
be of service to navigation.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES IN CASE OF WRECKS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>No consular officer is permitted to take any
action in case of a wreck, if the “owner, master
or consignee thereof is present and capable
of taking possession of the same”. If no such
person is present, the consul is required, so
far as the laws of the land permit, to take all
necessary action for the preservation of vessel
and cargo, and keep inventories of the same,
together with the expense involved. The consul
must make a full report of such wrecks to
the State Department, whether they occur
within his jurisdiction or are brought in.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case Americans are shipwrecked the consuls
are required to “render such assistance as
may be in their power”, but they are not authorized
to incur any expense with the expectation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>that it will be met by the State Department.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever foreigners render aid to shipwrecked
Americans, the Consul is required to
forward to the State Department an account
of the facts, giving the name of the master of
the foreign vessel and those of the crew who
especially distinguished themselves for heroism
or humanity. These details should be
quite exact, as they are to be laid before the
President, who is authorized by Congress to
make suitable acknowledgment. In some
cases the consul may reward a rescuing crew
out of funds at his disposal.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES TO OFFICERS—NAVAL AND DIPLOMATIC.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Duties to naval officers were mentioned in
connection with “rank” in the preceding lecture.
Officers of the Navy are under a reciprocal
duty to consuls, however, which should
be mentioned. On this point I quote the exact
words of the Regulations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Navy is an independent branch of the
service, not subject to the orders of the Department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of State, and its officers have fixed
duties prescribed for them; consuls will,
therefore, be careful to ask for the presence of
a naval force at their posts only when public
exigencies absolutely require it, and will then
give the officers in command the full reasons
for the request and leave with them the responsibility
of action. If the request is addressed
to the Department of State, the reasons
should likewise be fully stated for its information.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The diplomatic service has general supervision
over the consular service in any one
country. When there is a consul general, this
supervision is exercised through him, and the
consuls will not correspond officially with the
diplomatic officers—except in reply to inquiries.
Where there is no consul general the
consuls will correspond directly with the diplomatic
officials and “endeavor in all cases to
comply with their requests and wishes”.
Leaves of absence and recommendations for
appointment of subordinate officers are usually
sent through the diplomatic officers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Sometimes in the absence of a diplomatic officer
a consul general or consul may discharge
the duties of a diplomatic officer. Sometimes
the two offices are united in the one representative.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Consular officers will confer freely with
the Treasury revenue agents who may be appointed
to visit and examine the consulates.
They will remember, however, that these
agents have no authority to instruct them as
to their official acts”.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES OR RELATIONS TO SEAMEN.</h3>

<p class='c012'>To no other class of citizens, save in uncivilized
countries, does the consul stand in such
immediate relationship as to seamen. This
would seem to be because as a class, since
their occupation takes them to all parts of
the world and away from the protection of
their own country, and, moreover, because
they are laborers and not men of means, they
are more at the mercy of circumstances as well
as of unscrupulous masters in foreign lands.
On the other hand, justice to the masters
also requires national authority to enforce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>contracts and assist in securing harmony often-times
on shipboard. Fully 57 pages of
the Regulations are taken up with this subject
under the following heads:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_5'>
    <li>1. Shipment of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>2. Discharge of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>3. Wages and effects of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>4. Relief of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>5. Transportation of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>6. Desertion of seamen.
    </li>
    <li>7. Disputes between masters, officers and crews.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>A master of an American merchant vessel
who engages any seamen in a foreign port
must do so under penalty in the presence of
the American consul and only with his sanction.
The engagement must be signed in duplicate
by both master and men in the presence
of the consul, who must see to it that the
seamen understand clearly the terms of the
contract. Seamen may be engaged for a definite
time, for a round trip, for a single voyage
or “by the lay”, and the terms of the agreement
are called the “shipping articles”. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>case of desertion or casualty the master may
engage a number of seamen equal to the number
lost and report to the first consul he sees.
In case a vessel is purchased abroad and the
seamen “have not character of American seamen”
(subsequently defined), they do not
come within the jurisdiction of the consul.</p>

<p class='c008'>An American seaman is (1) an American
citizen or (2) a foreigner shipped in an American
vessel in an American port or (3) a foreign
seaman shipped in an American vessel in
either an American or a foreign port, who has
declared his intention in a competent court to
become a citizen of the United States and has
served three years thereafter on American
merchant vessels. For purposes of protection
the filing of the declaration is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>A consular officer may discharge a seaman
upon his own or his master’s application, provided
the terms of the agreement have been
fulfilled. He is also to give a certificate to
that effect to the seaman. Other cases where
American seamen are discharged abroad are
for sickness, misconduct, on the sale of American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>vessel, on account of ill treatment, when
vessel is wrecked or condemned as unseaworthy,
etc. The general policy of the government
is to “discountenance the discharge of
seamen in a foreign port”, and any master
who knowingly abandons a seaman abroad is
subject to fine and imprisonment. “Cases
have occurred in which the consular officers
have, with the subsequent approval of the Department
of State, removed masters of vessels
and appointed others in their places to complete
the voyage”, but this was only when the
“gross incompetency” of the masters endangered
the lives of passengers and crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>A consul in discharging a seaman, must see
to it that his wages are paid, otherwise “he
shall be held accountable to the United States
for the full amount thereof”.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the duty of the consul to provide for
destitute seamen, to secure their transportation
to the United States at government expense,
subject always to certain conditions,
and to take charge of their effects upon their
death at sea or in port.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The consular officers must help to reclaim
deserters and call in the assistance of the local
authorities for this purpose if necessary,
which they are authorized to do by treaty with
several countries and by comity or usage with
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the many interesting points in international
law is that of “mixed jurisdiction”, as
it is called, or jurisdiction within a harbor. A
dispute on shipboard on the high seas is
clearly within the jurisdiction of the country
under whose flag the vessel is sailing, but
when the vessel comes into the harbor of another
country it is just as clear that the jurisdiction
of that country is superior. As a matter
of practice, however, it has long been found
best to allow all such controversies occurring
on shipboard within a harbor to be tried by
the law and authorities to which the vessel is
subject, provided, of course, that “it does not
involve the peace or dignity of the country, or
the tranquility of the port” where it occurs. In
all such cases the consul, as the representative
of his government, acts as an officer of justice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Where he is authorized by treaty to call for
local aid he is cautioned not to do so if it
can be avoided. If such aid is refused, he
should lay claim to his treaty rights and then
report at once to the diplomatic officers in
the country and to the State Department.</p>

<p class='c008'>This hurried review of the consul’s relations
to seamen leaves a great deal unsaid, but the
main points, at least, have been touched upon.
Let us now turn to</p>

<h3 class='c011'>IMMIGRATION.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The old idea that this land is an asylum
for all kinds and conditions of men is now
happily exploded. The classes of aliens now
excluded are as follows:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>(a) Chinese laborers.
    </li>
    <li>(b) Contract laborers.
    </li>
    <li>(c) All idiots and insane persons.
    </li>
    <li>(d) Paupers or persons likely to become a public charge.
    </li>
    <li>(e) Persons suffering from a loathsome or contagious disease.
    </li>
    <li>(f) Felons and all criminals except political offenders; (and these latter are
    excluded if the penalty is removed upon condition of immigration).
    </li>
    <li><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>(g) Polygamists.
    </li>
    <li>(h) Assisted immigrants.
    </li>
    <li>(i) Abandoned women.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>Every master of a vessel having on board
immigrants bound for any port in the United
States is obliged upon arrival to submit a
manifest to the inspector of immigration. A
manifest is a list of the immigrants on board,
with a general description of each one, giving
name, age, sex, nationality, ability to read and
write, calling or occupation, means, destination,
etc. This must be subscribed and sworn
to by the master in the presence of the consul
before the vessel can leave port, and in like
manner the surgeon of the vessel must take
oath that he has made a personal examination
of each one and finds everything satisfactory.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>QUARANTINE.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Before clearing for any American port any
vessel in a foreign port must procure from the
consul a “bill of health”, which is a certificate
to the effect that the sanitary conditions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the vessel are satisfactory and that all rules
and regulations in such cases have been complied
with. The consul must take pains to satisfy
himself before granting the “bill of
health”, and for this purpose a medical officer
is often detailed by the Government. A master
of a vessel who sails into an American port
without having procured a “bill of health” is
liable to a fine not to exceed $5,000.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES TO CITIZENS OTHER THAN SEAMEN.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Citizens going abroad for business or pleasure
may find it to their advantage to inquire
into the consideration that Uncle Sam is prepared
to show them when abroad. The freedom
of travel you enjoy at home is a small
thing until, in a foreign land, you find yourself
confronted by an officer of the law demanding
your passports. Besides, there are
numerous little official courtesies for which
the traveler or sojourner will be very grateful,
and in cases of emergency assistance may be
rendered far beyond all adequate reward.</p>

<p class='c008'>As was said before, passports may be procured
from the State Department, otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>through the diplomatic officers, or in their absence,
through the consular service. If the applicant
is accompanied by his wife, minor children,
servant, etc., the one passport answers
for all.</p>

<p class='c008'>A consular officer may verify or visé (pronounced
vee-záy) a passport by writing on it
the word “good” in the language of the country,
and affixing his official signature and seal.
Diplomatic representatives should visé passports
only when there is no consulate in the
city where the legation is situated. A visé is
good only in the country where it is given.</p>

<p class='c008'>The government affords all the protection
it can under the circumstances. Of course it
can have no jurisdiction in criminal cases, except
in uncivilized countries, and it can have
no civil jurisdiction except by treaty or by the
law of the land. “The right of a citizen to
claim protection is founded upon the ‘correlative
right’ of his country to his ‘allegiance
and support.’” Consuls are “particularly cautioned
not to enter into any contentions that
can be avoided, either with their countrymen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>or with the subjects or authorities of the country.
They should use every endeavor,” continues
the “Regulations”, “to settle in an amicable
manner all disputes in which their countrymen
may be concerned, but they should
take no part in litigation between citizens.
They should countenance and protect them before
the authorities of the country in all cases
in which they may be injured or oppressed,
but their efforts should not be extended to
those who have been wilfully guilty of an infraction
of the local laws. It is incumbent
upon citizens of the United States to observe
the reasonable laws of the country where they
may be. It is their duty to endeavor on all
occasions to maintain and promote all the
rightful interests of citizens, and to protect
them in all privileges that are provided for by
treaty or are conceded by usage. If representations
are made to the local authorities and fail
to secure the proper redress, the case should
be reported to the consul general, if there be
one, or to the diplomatic representative if there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>be no consul general, and to the Department
of State.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I have quoted this passage almost entirely
because it is the best expression to be found,
probably, of the general attitude of the Government
of the United States toward its citizens
abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>Citizens intending to sojourn abroad should
register at the consulate within which they are
to reside. This is not required, but it may
be a great convenience both ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who are citizens? (1) “All persons born in
the United States and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof”; (2) all children born to such natives,
even if beyond the jurisdiction of the
United States; (3) “any white woman, or
woman of African nativity or descent, or Indian
woman, married to a citizen of the United
States, is a citizen thereof”; (4) naturalized
citizens; (5) the minor children of naturalized
citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An official letter of introduction, when
given to a citizen of the United States, is valuable
to the holder for prompt identification in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>case he needs the intervention of a consular
officer in his behalf. But in no case must the
letter be understood or taken as implying any
claim upon the consul for hospitality or personal
courtesies beyond the politeness always
due to citizens of the United States when they
have legitimate business with a consulate”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consuls are not allowed to give their names
as business references, nor to report the financial
standing of houses in their districts. Such
requests should be referred to banks or business
agencies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Consular officers are not authorized to indorse
notes or bills of exchange, nor in other
ways to become responsible pecuniarily for
American citizens or others who have no personal
claims upon them.” Such transactions
are not a part of the official duties of a consular
officer. He is “not authorized to lend
money to indigent citizens of the United
States or others, nor to incur expenses or liabilities
for any persons except seamen of the
United States, in the expectation of reimbursement
by the Government”.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Consular officers are forbidden to solemnize
marriages. A marriage may be solemnized in
the presence of a consular officer as a witness,
and in that case it has certain peculiarities,
as will be seen from the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>According to international law the mode of
solemnizing marriage conforms to the law of
the place where it is performed. But there
are many conceivable circumstances which
might make this undesirable, and in such cases
it is declared by the statutes that “marriages
in presence of any consular officer of the
United States in a foreign country, between
persons who would be authorized to marry if
residing in the District of Columbia, shall be
valid to all intents and purposes, and shall
have the same effect as if solemnized within
the United States”. In all such cases the consul
must give a certificate to each of the parties
and forward a copy to the Department of
State.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of the death of an American
citizen abroad, it is the duty of the consul to
take possession of his estate, provided there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>is no other legal representative, and provided,
also, the laws of the country so permit,—to
inventory the same with the help of two merchants
(Americans, preferably), to make collections
and to discharge the debts due from
the estate, to sell at public auction such part
as is of a perishable nature, and at the expiration
of one year the remainder, and finally to
transmit the proceeds to the Treasury of the
United States to be held in trust for the legal
claimants, who, however, are at liberty to appear
at any time and take charge of the proceedings
and the estate themselves. This applies
to personal property only—real estate
being administered according to the laws of
the locality. In the absence of a treaty covering
such points the consul is to proceed in the
above manner unless it is known that the local
authorities are unwilling, for “he should avoid
the appearance of opposing or disregarding
actual local requirements”.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same proceedings as the above are followed
in case a citizen dies on the high seas
“on either an American or a foreign vessel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and his effects are brought within a consular
district”.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>JUDICIAL DUTIES—IN NON-CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The use of the term “non-christian”, which
in the present day is giving place to “uncivilized”,
is as old as the consular system itself;
that is to say, it has come down to us from
mediaeval times when the consular system
originated. It might still have been retained
had it not been for the progress of one country,
Japan, which may be better described as
civilized rather than Christian.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judicial power of a consul, therefore,
remains as a relic of mediaevalism, and it remains
because the need remains; for just as
civilized countries five hundred years ago
were unwilling to look to the Turk for justice,
so they are to-day, and treaties to that effect
secure Turkish recognition of this humiliating
state of things. As it is with Turkey so it is
with China, Korea, Siam, Persia, Madagascar,
Borneo, etc., the treaties varying considerably
in each case.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>This assumption of superiority by the self-styled
civilized countries would be hard to
justify on the ground of theoretical ethics, but
apparently theoretical and practical or applied
ethics sometimes diverge very widely, and
when they do diverge no statesman hesitates
as to which he shall follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the tiresome details of Title XLVII,
U. S. Revised Statutes, which deals fully with
courts of this character, the following points
may be gleaned:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) Cases arising between Americans are
tried before American officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) Cases arising between Americans and
others not natives are arranged by their respective
consular officers; in Turkey they are
tried in the consulate of the defendant.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) Cases arising between Americans and
natives are tried before an American tribunal
in China, Siam and Madagascar; before a
mixed tribunal in Persia, the Barbary States
and Turkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is rather startling to notice the power
entrusted to one man, as is done by our government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in the case of the consuls to these
countries. A consul, for instance, can issue a
warrant for the arrest of a man merely upon
his own initiative, and can then proceed to
try him, he himself acting as judge and jury.
He first submits a list of men to the minister,
who selects from one to four to sit with him in
the trial as advisers. These advisers must record
and sign their judgment of the case, but
it is the consul’s judgment that condemns or
acquits.</p>

<p class='c008'>In trials for capital offenses there must be
four advisers, and their judgment must concur
with the consul’s, and their combined judgment
must be approved by the minister before
there can be conviction. In some cases appeal
may be made to the minister and rarely to a
U. S. circuit court, but in general the decision
of the consul is final. Hence, although the
power of life and death is lodged in the hands
of the consul, it is well safeguarded, and the
danger of its abuse is more apparent than real.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some miscellaneous duties devolving
upon the consular service which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>will notice briefly before turning finally to the
duties to the State Department.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>EXTRADITION.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Whenever a criminal attempts to escape justice
by fleeing to another country it is a delicate
matter to recapture him, necessarily; for
aside from the ordinary difficulties of the case
the powers add a few by their carefulness to
preserve each other’s dignity in such matters.
Thus the pursuit of a criminal by the officers
of one country into the territory of another,
even when permitted by treaty, may result in
a rather awkward state of things, especially if
what is regarded as a crime in the one is not
so much of a crime in the other. For instance,
suppose that the laws of Canada regarding
embezzlement are not as stringent as are
those of the United States, or suppose she
hasn’t any at all: one can see that a request by
our Government for the extradition of an embezzler
might strain international courtesy
more than a trifle. A treaty is a prerequisite
to extradition in any country, and fortunately
our Government has such treaties with most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of her neighbors, though there are some startling
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever a warrant or “requisition” is
made for a fugitive criminal it is usual to act
through a diplomatic officer. If it is made
through a consul it must first be with the
sanction of the State Department.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>TRANSFER OF FOREIGN VESSELS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The right of citizens to purchase foreign-made
vessels abroad involves the right to the
protection of those vessels. A vessel cannot
sail the high seas without registration and a
flag; for if she does she is liable to seizure as a
pirate. Hence the ceremony of transfer in
such a case must be attended to by the consul.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ordinarily this does not imply any great responsibility,
but while a war is in progress it
is a very different thing, no matter whether
we are neutrals or belligerents. To illustrate:
Suppose during the recent war the owner of
an American vessel wished to put it out of danger
by putting it under a neutral flag. This
he might do by a pretended sale to a citizen of
a foreign country through the connivance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>a consul. It is the consul’s duty, therefore,
to prevent such fraudulent sales, to take all
possible pains to satisfy himself that the sale
is or is not a genuine transaction.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>WATCHING ENEMY’S VESSEL.</h3>

<p class='c012'>In case of war with another power the consuls
are required to keep watch on the movements
of the enemy’s vessels and report
promptly to the Department.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>AS A FOREIGN AGENT.</h3>

<p class='c012'>During the progress of a war between two
foreign states our consuls may as a matter of
courtesy to one or both of them take charge
of its consular offices and effects. This must
be with the permission of the Secretary of
State, however, and the Government assumes
no responsibility for the acts of the consuls.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DUTIES TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT—AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The consular service may be likened to a
great reporting system. The consuls are reporters,
their offices are news agencies, their
field the world, their managing and publishing
office the State Department, their organ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Consular Reports, their readers—just a few
persons, here and there, whose numbers, by
the way, are increasing. In addition to the
correspondence which must be carried on in
connection with the duties mentioned, the
consul may have occasional correspondence
on public business with “the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Comptroller, the Auditor for the
State and other Departments, the Register of
the Treasury, collectors of customs as to invoices
and prices current, the diplomatic representative
of the United States in the country
where he resides, other consular officers, and
with naval or military officers in the service
of the United States who may be employed in
the neighborhood, and to whom it may be
necessary to communicate immediately any
event of public interest, and with no other
person”.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, I trust, will serve as a brief conspectus
of consular duties, and now we will listen to
questions.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>After dismissal a group of men including a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>banker, a merchant, two manufacturers, a
grain dealer, some traveling men, etc., made
their way to the platform and were introduced
to Professor Loyal as some of the business
men of the place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We suppose, Professor,” said one of them,
“that it is rather aside from your purpose to
tell us how to reach foreign trade—how to
get our goods on the market—and yet it is
the very thing we need to know; so if you can
give us any further light we shall appreciate
it”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very glad to hear you say so”, said
the Professor, “for that is just what the consular
service is intended to do, while my purpose
is to serve as an introduction committee
between you and the service. You will find
in the syllabi the name and address of every
member of the consular and diplomatic services
all over the world, and they, no doubt,
will furnish you all the information you need.
The Regulations, indeed, have this to say:
‘Inquiries made by citizens of the United
States touching business matters, or other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>matters not of mere curiosity, should be answered
as far as they can be consistently with
the consul’s other duties. All inquiries of this
character should be acknowledged, even when
it is impracticable to answer them’”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why not write at once to the State Department”?</p>

<p class='c008'>“That may be just as well. The supposition
is, however, if you know in what country you
expect to find your market the consular service
there can give you the most help, because
the local conditions are known. If you
do not know where to find your market, you
should at least familiarize yourself with the
Consular Reports, the ‘advance sheets’ of
which give the latest news from foreign markets.
If you are exporters you will have no
difficulty in obtaining these through your Congressmen”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you suppose, Professor, that a handbook
of directions to shippers could be prepared
by the Government—something to show
how goods should be manufactured or
packed, as well as cost of transportation, customs
duties in foreign ports, etc.”?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Yes, but you would find your handbook
growing to enormous size, until finally it
would be no less and no other than the Consular
Reports. The trouble is, or has been,
that people don’t read these enough. Now,
let us get an idea of what such a handbook
would contain. What do you manufacture”?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Farming machinery”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now let us suppose you have discovered
that there is a market for your merchandise
in Argentina. Suppose, too, that the
horses in that country are of lighter draft
than ours: then your machines must be lightened
correspondingly, and this involves a good
deal of detail. Again, their soil will differ from
that for which you are manufacturing, consequently
you may have to change the shape of
your plows, or the construction of your harrows,
or the size of your drills. Again, one
must make sure that the natives can handle
intricate machinery before sending any twine-binders,
steam-engines, etc. Then, too, you
must learn the strong and the weak points of
the machinery with which you are to compete.
So you see, when it is remembered that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>have been considering a few contingencies
in regard to only one line of industry, and
that, too, in only one country, the sum of the
contingencies is enormous. When it comes to
cottons or woolens the case is much the same;
the width, texture, color, pattern, price—everything
which makes goods salable in any
one country—must be known, and the advertisements
put in a way that appeals to native
sentiment and taste. In the Consular Reports
you will get the information you need, and you
will find it hard to be put in a handbook”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, as a matter of fact, I haven’t seen
much of the Consular Reports”, said one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor I, either”, said several others, as they
turned to go.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c007'>In 1815 the Congress of Vienna
adopted seven rules for the regulation
of diplomatic intercourse. The
United States was not represented
at this historic congress—wasn’t important
enough and perhaps wasn’t
interested enough; but it has chosen to conform
to the rules, nevertheless. The fact that
we had nothing to do with the promulgation
of these rules and that we are the only power
that has since grown into a commanding position,
gives us a diplomatic advantage, an independence
agreeable to our national ideals and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>geographical situation. The first of these
rules reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Article 1. Diplomatic agents are divided
into three classes: That of Ambassadors, legates
or nuncios; that of envoys, ministers or
other persons accredited to sovereigns; that of
chargés d’affaires accredited to ministers for
foreign affairs”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three years after the Congress of Vienna
the Congress of Aix la Chapelle adds an
eighth article, which reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Article VIII.—It is agreed that ministers
resident accredited to them” (to sovereigns,
presumably) “shall form, with respect to their
precedence, an intermediate class between
ministers of the second class and chargés
d’affaires”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consequently the classification of our diplomatic
officers is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Ambassadors. We do not send or receive
legates or nuncios, as there are representatives
of the Pope, and to do so would be
contrary to our national policy respecting
church and state.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>2. Envoys, ministers or other persons accredited
to sovereigns. This class includes
that official with the ridiculously lengthy title
of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary—usually
called minister “for
short”.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Ministers resident, who are usually also
consuls general. There are but four of these
in our service, and as there is little justification
for this grade it will probably some day be
abolished.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Chargés d’affaires (pronounced shar-zha-daffair),
who are not accredited to sovereigns,
but to the minister for foreign affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be borne in mind that this classification
has nothing whatever to do with the
transaction of business. All diplomats have
essentially the same duties to perform. It is
merely a matter of precedence, which was considered
much more important at the time of
the Vienna congress than it is now. Indeed,
there are good reasons for thinking that we
have outgrown these distinctions and should
straightway abandon them. This much, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>least, is apparent to all—that the chief diplomatic
officer at every legation ought to be an
ambassador, thus making no invidious distinctions
between countries.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/image132.jpg' alt='DIPLOMACY' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>As it is at present we send ambassadors to
the most important countries, envoys extraordinary
and ministers plenipotentiary to those
that are next important to us, and so on. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>there are five ambassadors; one each at London,
Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg and Mexico
respectively, thirty envoys extraordinary and
ministers plenipotentiary, four ministers resident,
and one who is classed as a chargé
d’affaires.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are secretaries of legation at twenty-three
different capitals, who in the absence of
their chief may become chargés d’affaires exercising
all the functions of a diplomatic officer.
At fourteen different capitals there are
military or naval attachés, sometimes both,
and an interpreter at six of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Legation, or embassy, formerly meant the
particular business, the errand, so to speak,
upon which the ambassador was sent.</p>

<p class='c008'>These terms are now used more often to
designate the officers themselves who are sent
on an embassy, and finally by the extension
of the term they also mean the official residence
of those officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>American legations as a rule have fewer
members than those of other great nations
and are much less expensive. The American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>diplomatic service costs only one fourth as
much as the British. Whether or not the result
is desirable upon the whole you may judge
for yourselves; for while it must be said that
we have as a rule been very well served diplomatically,
yet on the other hand one direct
result of our economy is that only men of
wealth can afford to be ambassadors. The
cost of living, and especially of entertaining,
is so high and the salary is so inadequate that
no man in ordinary circumstances can occupy
a high diplomatic position where the social requirements
are burdensome.</p>

<p class='c008'>In several cases the parsimony of the Government
has been quite contrary to its own
best interests. In Central and South America,
for instance, where we ought, by all means, to
be well represented, the same officer is frequently
accredited to two, or even three different
countries. Now, no country likes to
have a representative of an inferior grade accredited
to it, certainly not when a mere
change of title would mend the matter, but
when it comes to being bunched together with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>another country or two by a powerful and
wealthy neighbor it is almost insulting, and
the countries in question show a justifiable resentment.
In such countries we will find European
nations well represented, and yet we
wonder at our own loss of prestige.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>PURPOSE.</h3>

<p class='c012'>As long as the nations have any dealings
with each other as nations, so long will it
be necessary for them to have representatives,
honored and trusted by those who receive
them as well as those who send them, at each
other’s capitals. It might almost be said that
they exist for the prevention of business—the
business arising from misunderstandings—for
their primary duty is, while representing
their own nation with dignity and reserve, to
cultivate friendly relations with the power to
which they are accredited, as far as circumstances
will allow. To do this they interpret
the public acts of their own government as it
wishes to be understood, and are frequently
entrusted with large discretionary powers for
this purpose. Moreover, they expedite business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and help to avoid annoyances in a very
large measure. The government at Washington,
for instance, wishes to know the attitude
of the government at Berlin upon a certain
matter without making it too formal or exaggerating
its importance, and accordingly application
is made at once either to the German
ambassador residing at Washington or to the
American ambassador in Berlin, either of
whom, if it lies within his discretion, gives
the desired information. If the whole thing is
quietly done, so as to escape general notice,
it saves needless wild guessing as to what it
all means; and this is greatly to be desired
when things are in an acute stage, if not at
other times. The recent triumph of the
“open door” policy in China was accomplished
in this quiet, effective way.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that the modern conception
of the function of a diplomat makes him
a resident of the country of his embassage during
the time of his appointment. Moreover,
that he is not sent on any stated errand, as for
instance, the negotiation of a treaty, or as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>member of an international congress. This
latter, to be sure, is diplomatic business, but
the agents employed are usually termed commissioners.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>ORIGIN.</h3>

<p class='c012'>It was in this latter sense, however, that
the term ambassador was originally used.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just when it had its origin it would be hard
to say, but it was so far back in antiquity that
the sanctity of religion must needs be thrown
about the persons of the officials to shield
them from violence. In ancient times when an
ambassador went to a foreign court he went
with a special message, and having delivered
it and received a reply, his business was ended
and he returned homeward. His official dignity
was but little inferior to that of the sovereign.
Indeed he represented not only his
country but the person of his sovereign, and
he was accredited not to any foreign minister,
but directly to the sovereign. Hence his visit,
especially if friendly, was attended with an
elaborate display of pomp and ceremony, the
exchange of gifts and courtly compliments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and it would have been a royal sight to have
beheld his journey through the</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“lovely land ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose loveliness was more resplendent made</div>
      <div class='line'>By the mere passing of that cavalcade</div>
      <div class='line'>With plumes and cloaks and housings, and the stir</div>
      <div class='line'>Of jeweled bridle and of golden spur”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When he began to stay abroad, some four
or five hundred years ago, his purpose was
mischievous. He stayed to act as a court
spy and intriguer, to find out secrets while
keeping his own. A certain diplomat of the
seventeenth century is said to have written in
praise of his occupation, diplomacy “causes
sudden revolutions in great states. It excites
hatreds, jealousies and seditions. It arms
princes and whole nations against their own
interests; it forms leagues and other treaties
among sovereigns and peoples whose interests
are quite opposed to one another; it destroys
those leagues and snaps the closest
ties asunder”. There is no doubt as to what
this means. It is war—polite war, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>please, where the weapons are deception,
hypocrisy, insinuation and innuendo—the
meanest kind of war, where cowards may be
greater than heroes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they lie to you, lie still more to them”,
was the naive instruction given by one sovereign
to his ambassadors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not to multiply instances on a point where
history is unfortunately too full, it is interesting
to notice, as some one has pointed out,
that with rapid communication by train and
by telegraph, court intrigues have gradually
died away; for now that the capitals of the
world are within “whispering distance” of
each other, as it were, ambassadors have assumed
a position of secondary importance to
the minister for foreign affairs (or in America
the Secretary of State), an officer who resides
at the home capital.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>PRECEDENCE.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Naturally enough, one of the questions of
greatest concern at a mediaeval court was that
of precedence—who was the biggest man, and
the next and so on. Talk about comic opera!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>In more than one historic instance the question
of precedence among diplomats, or the
consequent squabbles between their trains of
attendants, fairly “out-Herods Herod” in
farcicalness. “The Conferences of Ryswyk”,
we are told, “were held in a house which
seemed to have been built for the purpose,
with three separate entrances and every convenience
for preventing collisions; but it was
found impossible from first to last to sit at the
single table in the rooms assigned to the
mediators, because no agreement could be
come to about the order of sitting; in that
room they could only stand; they sat in a
circle in another room where there was no
table. A Latin protocol, which had been preserved
of the proceedings at Nymegen eighteen
years before, was produced as a precedent,
but in vain; it contained a plan of the
room used at Nymegen, showing the arrangement
of seats in it, together with the positions
of the doors, windows and fireplace—for these
things may be important in determining which
is the top and which the bottom of a table.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>A round table was used at Cambray, Soissons
and Aix la Chapelle; but even a round table
loses its accommodating quality when it is
discovered that the place of honor is that opposite
the door, and that every place of honor
has a right hand and a left.” A quarrel between
two ambassadors’ wives has seriously
interfered with international negotiations, and
a coachman’s obstinacy has added thirty pages
to the “Compleate History of the Treaty of
Utrecht.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>MODERN DIPLOMACY—CHARACTER.</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is not to be supposed that modern diplomacy
has so completely changed character as
to lose all of its disagreeable features, for there
is still more or less mediaevalism attaching to
it—at least if the popular conception be true.
And perhaps in some degree it must always
be so; for the office is unique in its opportunities
as well as its inducements to dissimulate,
mislead and misrepresent. In the first
place, the diplomat undertakes his mission
under secret instructions. The public may
know what are the duties of the consular service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>as fully as the consuls themselves; but not
so with the diplomatic service, for to the
public it is a closed door. Moreover, our
diplomat may reason with himself that business
of any kind involving competition is a
kind of warfare; that diplomatic business is
especially so because it is international, that
there is no penalty for the breaking of an international
law, and thus he may be led to
conclude that “all’s fair in love and war”,
especially war.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be necessary for some if not all of
the members of a legation to maintain a
“discreet inquisitiveness”; it certainly is necessary
for all to know how to meet indiscreet
questions with non-committal answers; yet
the finesse of diplomatic intrigue is dangerous
ground and British and American diplomats
have, in the main, done well to avoid it. The
chief of a legation especially should remember
that his office is a noble one and should be
kept above the stifling air of intrigue; that
the dignity of a nation may easily be compromised
by the mere suspicion of complicity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>therein, and that to those among whom he
moves he both represents his country officially
and typifies his countrymen personally. The
American diplomat has gained something of
a reputation for going straight at the mark—of
leaving no doubt as to the attitude of his
government and the policy he is to follow,
and is not this the true diplomacy? The
ruling purpose should not be to gain one’s
point, but to preserve the national dignity
while using all honorable means to gain the
point.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much depends upon the manner of a
diplomat. Men ordinarily admire and covet
a certain plainness and directness of speech
which in business may amount even to bluntness.
But frankness of speech which in any
other occupation might prove only disadvantageous,
in diplomacy amounts to a complete
disqualification. In business a diplomat must
be all ears and no tongue until the time comes
for him to speak, then he must know exactly
what to say and what not to say. He may
feel that every man has a right to an opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and to the expression of it, but being a diplomat
he must remember that his opinion will
be regarded as official whether or not he intends
it so, and therefore it must be guarded
religiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>In society, somewhat to the contrary, there
should be no outward indication of a studied
reserve—nothing that would serve as a restraint
upon his freedom of movement and
conversation. He should be a man of engaging
manners, of suave and polite address, and
of affability and urbanity in conversation. He
should not only be well trained in the usages
of good society, but should also thoroughly
acquaint himself with the traditional usages
and customs, the etiquette of the court where
he is to reside.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>ACCEPTABILITY.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Since the principal purpose in sending ambassadors
is to secure peace by cultivating
friendly relations with other governments, it
is evidently wise before making an appointment
to any country to learn whether the
person whom it is expected to send is acceptable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>to that country. Accordingly it is customary
before making the appointment public
to make the nomination privately to the foreign
government and to express the hope that
it will be found acceptable. Even the nominee
knows nothing of it, and is thus saved
the pain of rejection in case that should occur.
If there is no personal objection to the
nominee, and if there is no doubt that his
country possesses full sovereignty and is therefore
entitled to send ambassadors, his government
is notified of the fact that he is acceptable;
but should there be any objection to
him—and sometimes very trifling ones will
suffice—his government is notified that he is
<i>persona non grata</i> (not an agreeable person),
and it proceeds to make other nominations.
Not only has the foreign government the right
to reject a nominee but also to demand his
recall at any time if there is any well grounded
dissatisfaction with him. One American ambassador
was recalled because complaint was
made about his bad manners.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>SOVEREIGNTY OF A STATE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Since the power to send ambassadors is conditioned
upon the sovereignty of a state we
may be pardoned for a glance at international
law for the meaning of sovereignty. The essential
attributes of a state are—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>(1) Equality—in a legal sense—a small country the equal of a larger one.
    </li>
    <li>(2) Independence, freedom from all other states.
    </li>
    <li>(3) Sovereignty.
    </li>
    <li>(4) Fixed locality—boundary.
    </li>
    <li>(5) Its people must be organized into a political society.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>Woolsey, who mentions the first three only,
says that they “cannot exist apart, and perhaps
the single conception of sovereignty, or
of self-protection, may include them all”. It
is “the power of entering into relations with
other states and of governing its own subjects”.
Thus it follows that no dependency or
colony can send a diplomat of any rank whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the appointment of any one to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>diplomatic service, the manner of which will
be mentioned later, he must take the oath of
allegiance and is then given a pamphlet of
printed instructions by the State Department.
He is furnished with a letter of credence from
the President to the foreign government and
is expected to reach his post within a given
time, and to stay there until the expiration of
his appointment unless he is given special permission
to leave. Having reached his destination,
he is formally presented to the sovereign,
unless he is a chargé d’affaires, makes
calls upon his colleagues, and secures his exequatur.
It is wise to make an early call upon
the dean of the diplomatic body, who is generally
the oldest official member of the diplomatic
corps, for instruction as to local customs,
ceremonies and etiquette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our government has generally assumed an
attitude of indifference to matters of form and
ceremony—an independence which has cost
it no little prestige, and its diplomats a great
deal of annoyance. It should be granted that
forms and ceremonies have their place in diplomatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>affairs, and that each court or capital
has a right to its own long-established usages.
But we have rather been inclined to turn up
our noses at such foreign nonsense, forgetting
that in matters of form there is sound discretion
in the precept, “When in Rome do as
the Romans do”. But the government seems
to have cared less for the art of being agreeable
than for the science of being successful,
regardless of the fact that in diplomacy the
one is a prerequisite to the other. Two illustrations
of this may be given—the appointment
of ambassadors and the question of a
diplomatic uniform.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only within the present decade that
the United States has begun to exercise its
constitutional right to be represented wherever
it chooses by diplomats of the first rank,
i. e., ambassadors. Previously its highest
representatives abroad were diplomats of the
second rank, i. e., ministers, who though thoroughly
competent to handle the business were
simply out-ranked by every ambassador of
every second or third rate power in the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>This we could afford to ignore so far as it is
merely a question of sentiment, but when it
compels an American diplomat after waiting
hours for an audience to give place to any ambassador
who happens along, and when it implies
an acceptance on our part of a secondary
place among the nations, it is sheer nonsense
to continue the practice. Our reasons were,
first an ambassador is supposed to represent
the person of his sovereign, and as we have
no sovereign we should have no ambassadors;
and second, the office itself was supposed to
involve a greater outlay of money and a more
gorgeous and elaborate display than was consistent
with the simplicity of republican tastes.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the diplomatic uniform, which is not
the same thing as a court dress, by the way,
the same objections have been urged. The
mistake that we have made is in assuming
that “the rule should emanate from home, and
not from abroad”; for while we have an undoubted
right to establish our own customs at
our national capital, others might be excused
for thinking us priggish when we attempt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>carry those customs abroad, especially when
in defiance of customs in general usage and
of long standing. But so it stands recorded in
the statutes, that American diplomatic officers
shall wear no distinguishing uniform; and as
a consequence, at an evening reception in
some brilliant foreign capital you will see the
diplomatic corps of other nations appropriately
distinguished, while the American diplomat
appears in the costume worn by the servants
and waiters, that is, plain evening dress.
What diplomats sometime complain of in this
connection is not the lack of distinction, but
that they are rather unpleasantly distinguished.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>PRIVILEGES.</h3>

<p class='c012'>An ambassador enjoys unusual privileges
from the time he enters until the time he
leaves the country where he is sent, and these
we will now briefly consider. They have been
classified under the heads of inviolability and
exterritoriality, though they may be considered
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inviolability means that “neither public authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>nor private persons can use any force
or do any violence to him, without offending
against the law of nations”. Of course if he
attempts any violence toward other individuals
he becomes amenable to the local authorities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exterritoriality means the right while sojourning
in a foreign country to remain subject
to the laws of his own, in both criminal
and civil jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c008'>These privileges are granted because it is
thought that an ambassador cannot fully and
freely represent his own country if he is liable
to be interfered with by the state to which he
is accredited. When carried out to their practical
application some curious results are
reached; for instance—</p>

<p class='c008'>1. These privileges extend to his goods
and his lodgings. “His house is a sanctuary—except
in case of a gross crime—for himself
and his retinue”. His official papers and archives
are inviolate. He cannot shelter any
fugitive from law, although even this—the
right of asylum—was at one time general.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>2. The courtesy of exemption from taxation
is usually extended to ambassadors, as
well as exemption from duties on all necessary
articles of his household.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Owing to the inviolability of his property
it is hard to collect a debt from an ambassador
when he has a mind not to pay—a thing which
has happened more than once.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The right to his own form of worship is
granted to an ambassador and his retinue, even
when his religion is not otherwise tolerated by
the laws of the land. In this latter case it is
sometimes provided that it must be simply
“house worship—without bell, organ or other
sign indicating to passengers in the street that
a chapel is near by”;—“a native of the country
cannot attend”, and the “chaplain must not
appear abroad in his canonicals”.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Exemptions from local jurisdiction apply
to the secretary of legation, the chaplain,
physician, private secretary and even to domestic
servants. They apply even to domestic
servants who are natives of the country
though in a limited degree.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>6. The jurisdiction of an ambassador over
the members of his train is limited to minor
matters. A criminal would be sent home for
trial, the ambassador collecting and forwarding
all the evidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have purposely deferred the subject of the
selection of diplomatic officers until after a
consideration of the service itself, in order
that we may the better understand what is
needed in such an officer.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that the requirements
for a successful diplomat are wholly unlike
those for a consul. To be successful in the
consular service one must first of all be a good
business man. One should have a mind for
details, a quick and keen commercial insight,
an acquaintance with the material facts of life,
and the proper training would be that of the
merchant or the journalist, supplemented in
some cases by that of the lawyer and jurist.
There is a definite, body of information which a
consul should have at his command, a body of
rules whose authority he must not transgress,
and in the transaction of his business if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>looks to precedent it is only for present guidance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diplomat on the other hand should first
of all be a statesman. To belong to the first
rank, along with the greatest in the world,
he must have the gift of prophecy and the
grace to keep it quiet. In the pursuit of a
great national ambition he should have wisdom
to foresee, genius to plan and tact to execute.
His study is of men, the history and
the political institutions of men, the history
and tendencies of his own times, and the capacities
and characteristics of different races.
These things are his science, furnishing the
basis for his art, that art which Bacon called
the highest of all—the art of “working” men.
He cannot, in the nature of the case, expect
to receive very definite instruction from his
government, unless it be upon a specific line
of policy and an acquaintance with the treaties
between the two countries. Precedents are
of value to him as a guide to present action,
but more especially as affecting future policy;
for a nation’s foreign policy is influential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>among other nations and satisfactory at home
in proportion as it is self-consistent and just.
In great international emergencies the diplomat
sometimes does the work of a military
chieftain, but with these differences: his
means are peaceful, his warfare is necessarily
in secret, the results are bloodless, and, when
all is done, the skill with which he has fought
is seldom recognized except by the historian.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately the practical problem of choosing
men for the diplomatic service does not
contemplate deeds of such momentous character—at
least not for beginners—but it does
indicate the magnitude of the scale of operations
sometimes carried on by this service
which makes history no less than do military
campaigns. It is evident, moreover, that no
course of study however long can prepare a
man for the diplomatic service, except in an
elementary way. It goes without saying that
such elementary preparation should be made
before entering the service, and that it should
include among other essentials a knowledge of
French, Spanish or German, especially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>first which has been called the language of
diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>But after all, the only satisfactory preparation
for the diplomatic service is experience.
Some years ago the United States began a
system, pursued more or less by other nations,
of appointing young men to various legations
as attachés without salary. In this capacity
they became acquainted with diplomats and
the “ins and outs” of diplomacy, and incidentally
gave their superiors a chance to discover
their fitness or unfitness for the service. The
advantages of such a system, which has been
abandoned except as to the appointment of
military and naval attachés, must be apparent
to all, and it is hard to see why it should not
be reinstated.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of definite training and
knowledge to furnish a basis for examination
the diplomatic service is either exceptionally
fortunate or exceptionally unfortunate. As
long as the good of the service is kept chiefly
in view in the selection of candidates, even
though the service be regarded as political, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>is well that technical knowledge cannot interfere
seriously with the appointment of the
most promising candidate. On the other
hand, when the service is regarded as a legitimate
means of rewarding political friends it
will suffer all the more for the want of a restraint
such as the examination affords, just as
with the consular service, only in a greater
degree.</p>

<p class='c008'>Diplomatic officers are more apt to change
with the change of administration than are
consular officers, for the reason that the service
itself is more political in character. Some
authorities go so far as to justify the change
on the ground that the administration ought
to be unrestricted in carrying out its policy,
and therefore should be represented abroad
by those of its own political faith just as it is
in the cabinet. It must be admitted that there
is a great deal to justify this contention, but
it should be said that the analogy with the
President’s cabinet is hardly fair; for in the
latter case the parties are the units, and we
recognize the right of the stronger party to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>full executive power; but in the case of the
ambassadors the nation is the unit which he
represents, not the party. Theoretically the
change of diplomatic officials with the change
of administration cannot be justified, and practically
a sweeping change is certainly demoralizing
to our interests. In the most important
positions, however, it may sometimes be best
that the President be allowed to substitute
those of his own party.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the present system of recruiting the
diplomatic service the most essential point is
to lodge the testing power in the hands of
capable and incorruptible men, so that those
who are “appointed for examination” will not
necessarily pass because of the influence which
supports them.</p>

<p class='c008'>I will now leave the subject with you,
merely remarking in closing that diplomacy,
especially American diplomacy, which lies
outside of and beyond our present theme, is
of fascinating interest and will well repay careful
study. Our diplomatic history is brief,
but it is glorious, chiefly because it has made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>for righteousness and peace, not to ourselves
only but to all the world.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>“Professor, will you kindly give the remainder
of the articles of the Congress of Vienna”?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly. Besides the first and the last
which have already been given, they are as
follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. II. Ambassadors, legates, or nuncios
only have the representative character; (that
is, can represent the person of the sovereign).</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. III. Diplomatic agents on an extraordinary
mission have not, on that account,
any superiority of rank; (e. g., our commissioners
at the Hague conference would not
for that reason outrank our diplomatic representative
there, supposing the latter not to be
a commissioner).</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. IV. Diplomatic officers shall take
precedence in their respective classes according
to the date of the official notification of
their arrival. The present regulation shall not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>cause any innovation with regard to the representative
of the Pope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. V. A uniform mode shall be determined
in each state for the reception of diplomatic
agents of each class.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. VI. Relations of consanguinity or of
family alliance between courts confer no precedence
on their diplomatic agents. The
same rule applies also to political alliances.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art. VII. In acts or treaties between several
powers which grant alternate precedence,
the order which is to be observed in the signatures
shall be decided by lot between the
ministers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Are these the only international rules
concerning diplomats”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “They are the only ones given in the
Diplomatic and Consular Register”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Are they universally accepted”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “By all except Turkey, which recognizes
but three grades—ambassadors, ministers
and chargés d’affaires”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Suppose we send a diplomat of the
second rank to any country: have we a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to receive one of the same grade in return”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Certainly, and no more. Italy, however,
sends us an ambassador, while our representative
to Italy is a minister”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Professor, you will allow me to disagree
with you upon the propriety of wearing
a uniform”?</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “Certainly, what have you to say”?</p>

<p class='c008'>Q. “Well, nothing new; it is only that as
a people we have taken a wise stand in favor
of simplicity as opposed to meaningless conventionalities,
and that it should characterize
all our official relations with foreign powers,
otherwise we would seem to compromise our
position”.</p>

<p class='c008'>A. “I’ll admit,” said the Professor, “that
yours is the view ordinarily taken and officially
adopted in our country. But I still
maintain that it is a wrong view because it is
founded upon a wrong principle, namely that
‘the rule should emanate from home’. Why,
suppose you go to visit a neighbor and you
find that the rules of his household are somewhat
unlike your own: would you not as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>possible try to conform to them? Of course
you would; and the complaisance that is to be
expected between neighbors is a duty as between
ambassadors, because it is their business
to remove friction, not to create it. Oh, well,
these are trifles and need not be dwelt upon
were it not that they are conspicuous trifles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the mention of these matters of etiquette
reminds me of a suggestion by Schuyler,
to the effect that a bureau of ceremonies
should be added to the State Department—just
as in Paris there is a Service du Protocol—both
to facilitate its correspondence and
to serve as an intermediary between the Department
and foreign diplomats in Washington.
There are many reasons—small in themselves,
but rather weighty taken together, why
this suggestion is worth heeding. The Master
of Ceremonies plays a very important as
well as a conspicuous part in nearly every
capital except Washington; and perhaps he
is all the more necessary with us because we
have so little ceremony”.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dismission a group of ladies was observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>in earnest conversation waiting for a
word with the Professor, who soon advanced
with: “Do you wish to speak to me”?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we were just wondering”, said one of
them, “why women wouldn’t make good ambassadors”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They do”, said the Professor, “and excellent
ones, too, for women are generally diplomats
both by nature and training”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never heard of one’s being appointed”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it is always her husband that is appointed;
but this is dangerous ground. It is
a fact well known in the service that a discreet
wife can almost double her husband’s efficiency.
In the first place she hears as much
gossip as he does—as much, I say—and if she
can keep it, why that is the best way that a
diplomat can learn what is going on. But
aside from court gossip, a great deal of an
ambassador’s influence depends upon his position
in society and this in turn depends very
much upon the kind of wife he has. An indiscreet
wife, one who is over fond of gossip, or
under fond of society, might be a positive disqualification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>for the best kind of ambassador.
It should go without saying that the wife
should be patriotic; only sometimes diplomats
will marry abroad. On this point Schuyler
says that Bismarck always insisted that German
diplomats should marry German wives.
Women are very important social factors at
every capital, and even sovereigns find that
they are to be reckoned with. A good story
is told by Schuyler which illustrates this fact
and which shows at the same time what diplomacy
can do in small things. I give it as
nearly as I recall in his words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The court of Vienna is bound by very
strict rules of etiquette, which not even the
Emperor feels at liberty to overstep. And the
society of Vienna has adopted still stricter
ones. In order for an Austrian lady to be
able to appear at court, she must show at
least four generations of nobility. It is said
that some years ago when the first bourgeois
ministers were appointed in Austria, while
they were officially invited to a court ball,
their wives were omitted. The ladies were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>indignant and brought a sufficient pressure to
bear upon the husbands to induce them to
resign their offices if their wives were not invited
to the ball. The Emperor was in a dilemma,
for he could not dispense with such
useful ministers, neither could he override the
rules of court etiquette. He adopted, however,
a very simple expedient—he ennobled
the long-deceased great-grandfathers of the
ladies in question, which thus gave them the
personal right to appear”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have diplomats nothing better to do than
simply to get along peaceably with each
other”?</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be confessed that in spite of the
grand part they are expected to play upon
occasion, a large share of their time and attention
is devoted to the art of being agreeable—not
a mean art in its way, though it demands
attention to trifles after a fashion that
would be exasperating to some minds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I understand that it is in this exasperating
art, the minor tactics of diplomacy,
that women have the credit of excelling”?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“It is in this that they certainly do excel;
and indeed in major tactics or world politics
one need not ask for a better diplomat for her
day and her nation than ‘Good Queen Bess’,
not to mention other illustrious examples”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well”, said one of the ladies, as they turned
to go, “since to be an ambassador a woman
must either be born one or marry one, why
we might as well settle down to minor tactics
where we are; so have a care, Professor, for
we may not have learned the art of being
agreeable”.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c007'>Uncle Sam has lately gone abroad after
an entirely new fashion—new at least
to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to Hawaii only after repeated and
urgent invitation; hesitating because he
thought it was against his principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to Cuba to help the people to get

some hard thinking about it, just as he has

<p class='c008'>It is to this problem that we will now address

or if you please, imperialism.</p>

<p class='c008'>First of all, the occupation of the Philippines
by the United States is regarded by the average
American citizen as a moral question.
“Is it right to extend our authority over the
Philippines, even, if necessary, by force of
arms”? This is the question we all have been
asking ourselves, the question that the “anti-imperialists”
have promptly answered in the
negative, while the great majority of opinion

<p class='c008'>But the answer to this question, startling as
it may seem, is that it is not primarily an
ethical question, whatever ethical phases it
may have. “What,” you ask, “do not all governments
derive their just powers from the
consent of the governed?” Well, let us see
about that; and in order to see clearly and
dispassionately let us get outside of America
as it were, so that we may look at this proposition
from a convenient distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>People sometimes make mistakes. Whole
nations sometimes make the same mistake.
Indeed, on a fundamental proposition a whole
civilization during successive periods of history
covering many centuries has been known
to swing from one extreme to the other and
backward again. Such movements are often
likened to the swing of a mighty pendulum, or
better still, to the rising and narrowing coils
of a spiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>Naturally, one of the subjects upon which
men have thought the most and disagreed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>most and therefore made the most mistakes
is the relation of the individual to the state.
Less than three centuries ago one of the fundamental
maxims of government was that the
individual exists for the state and not the state
for the individual. This is one extreme. Up
to the time of Rousseau there was no marked
philosophical change upon this subject on the
continent of Europe. With him and those
after him began that marvelous reaction—that
tidal wave of philosophic thought and popular
conviction away from absolutism and in
the direction of the rights of man. If this
movement should reach its climax in the opposite
extreme it would mean anarchy—and
that is what it reached in the French Revolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was but a few years before its climax,
however, that our own Declaration of Independence
was written, the writers whereof
were thoroughly in sympathy with the movement
toward the rights of man. Hence we
hear in America the calm statement, “We believe
that all men are by nature free and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>equal”, while in France we hear the frenzied
cry, “Liberty! Equality! Fraternity!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The individual has at last secured his long
coveted freedom. But it is only to be confronted
with a still greater question, namely:
What is he to do with his freedom? How is
he to use it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, what has he done with it? In America,
as elsewhere, notwithstanding his political
creed, he has wisely decided that the
insane must not enjoy either freedom or
equality with other men. No more can criminals;
no more do women. Why? If all have
a right to these things, who dares take it away?</p>

<p class='c008'>This brings us to a point beyond the statement
of the Declaration, a point, however,
that must have been in the minds of the
writers, namely, that</p>

<h3 class='c011'>SELF-GOVERNMENT IS NOT SO MUCH A RIGHT AS IT IS A CAPACITY.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Have you a right to vote, and if so where
did you get it? You may answer these questions
just as you please; but the fact is, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>you go insane or commit a crime the government
takes away your right to vote because
of your incapacity. You are assumed to have
the capacity and therefore the right unless it
is proved to the contrary; but let it not be
forgotten that the capacity is fundamental and
antecedent to the right, otherwise our theory
will always seem inconsistent with our practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>And that is what mystifies so many of us
just now. We have made no mistake in our
practice, but we have made a mistake in trying
to justify the practice by an unfounded
theory, and it doesn’t work. We as a nation
have simply been idealizing the rights of man,
liberty and self-government, forgetting that
these are all secondary to capacity, just as
did the eighteenth century doctrinaires.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far with the analogy. Now, can any one
give a good, valid reason why the same conclusions
would not apply to a community or
tribe or race within a state which is held to be
incapable—the Indians, for instance, or the
emancipated slaves? Certainly not. Now, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>there any ethical reason why the same conclusions
would not apply to an incompetent nation?
Certainly not. The difficulty to be
encountered is a practical one, because, first,
there is no international court to decide upon
the capacity of a race to govern itself, and,
second, there is no international power to act
as guardian for incompetent or backward
races.</p>

<p class='c008'>How is it with the family of nations to-day?
A few of them are forging ahead at a marvelous
rate, a good many more are like Micawber’s
wife, continually <i>in statu quo</i>, while
others still are suffering a noticeable decline,
and finally there are races or tribes which have
never been organized into states or nations,
and which if left to themselves probably never
will be. And to what shall we liken this family
of nations? It is like a settlement beyond the
frontier of civilization, with no law above
them except a neighborhood agreement—a
settlement made up of a few progressive men,
a number of “ne’er do weels”, several idiots
and insane and a number of dissolutes. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>best that one could hope for in such a situation
would be for the progressive men to infuse
some life and energy into the “ne’er do
weels”, remove all destructive agencies from
the hands of the idiots and insane and put the
dissolutes under watch and ward. Instead,
however, the state of things that we actually
see is this: the dissolutes are rebellious, the
idiots are idiots, the “ne’er do weels” are suspicious,
and worst of all, the progressive men
are jealous of each other. In the absence of
cohesiveness and harmony in this settlement,
one of these progressive men has shown a disposition
sometimes domineering, sometimes
kindly, but a disposition nevertheless to maintain
law and order, and a fondness for having
a hand in enforcing it, and that man is Mr.
Anglo-Saxon. He never puts his hand to
this business without calling down the imprecations
of the whole neighborhood upon
himself as a tyrant, and yet freedom, prosperity
and progress go with him. He doesn’t
believe much in passive goodness. He has
learned the lesson of self-government and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>proposes to teach it to his less progressive
neighbors whether or no; and when they
have once learned it they may stay under his
protection or not, just as they please, and the
significant fact is that they are not only glad
to stay but to fight for him when they have
once learned his idea of freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fanatic may say, “I prefer my own government,
not because it is the best, but because
it is mine”. That may well be as between
two progressive nations, but as between a
progressive and a retrograde or incompetent
government, it is sheer fanaticism. It avails
nothing in such a case to quote the words of
Lincoln: “No man is good enough to govern
another man against that other man’s consent”,
for these words were uttered concerning
human bondage which is by no means analogous
to a loss of independence by a state.
Canada has no political independence, technically,
but are Canadians in bondage? Are the
Australians, the Hindus, the Egyptians, in
bondage?</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='backwoods'></a>No nation has a right to remain in the backwoods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>(pardon the homely expression). The
facilities for travel and inter-communication
are so vastly improved the “double coincidence
of wants and possessions” has become
so general, the bar of language, custom, religion
and race is so rapidly disappearing—in
a word, the nations of the earth are becoming
such near neighbors to each other that each
must be personally interested, so to speak, in
the welfare of the others. If a man’s nearest
neighbors are some miles distant, the way they
get their living or govern their households
may be of small interest to him; but let them
move up to adjoining lots and it makes a
world of difference whether their business is
reputable, and whether their households are
quiet and orderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>No nation is safe when it remains in the
backwoods. When two races, a more civilized
and a less civilized, come into close quarters
as neighbors the latter must improve or go to
the wall. And this is not so much a moral
as it is a physical question; for an area of land
that will support one hunter will support a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>hundred farmers, and nature is economic in
this as in every other matter. It is not so
much that the weak must yield to the strong
as it is that the ineffectual must give way to
the effectual—just the ordinary law of evolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like all natural laws it is merciless; and
being a natural law it is neither to be condemned
nor justified; yet again, like other
natural laws, its rigor may and should be mitigated.
In short, the superior race should
regard the inferior much as a schoolmaster
does an intractable youth, who must be dealt
with kindly and patiently, admonished repeatedly
and perhaps punished severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>No nation has a right to remain in the backwoods.
A country that shuts its eyes to progress
in other lands, a people whose all-sufficient
answer is, “What was good enough for
our fathers is good enough for us”, a nation
which stands for tyranny, for corruption, for
instability, for retrogression, of any sort, has
no one to blame but itself when the widening
breach which separates it from advancing civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>is closed with a violence that destroys
its identity.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/image182.jpg' alt='A MENACE.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>An unstable government is a standing menace
to all neighboring governments. It is
the rottenness of Turkey, more than the cupidity
of the powers, that constantly endangers
the peace of Europe. It was the rottenness
of Spanish colonial administration and not
our own cupidity, that brought on the Spanish
war. It is the turbulence of the South
American republics rather than their weakness,
that in spite of the protection of the
Monroe doctrine may yet invite European intervention.
The culpability of the incompetent
powers is a theme we hear much less
about than the “rapacity” of the “harpy powers”—and
why? Because of that childish
tendency to take the part of the “under dog”,
no matter whose the fault.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>It would seem a necessary conclusion, therefore,
that whenever a people demonstrates its
incapacity to learn self-government by its own
unaided effort, or whenever from any cause its
civilization is far in the rear of the times, that
the best interests both of itself and of the rest
of humanity demand that it be placed under
a governmental pedagogue, at least until it
attains its majority. And this is no less true
though the people rebel and many lives be
lost, provided that it means progress for the
race—“the greatest good to the greatest number”.
Who would claim that Egypt would be
better off without the wise guidance of England,
or who now counts the lives that were
lost in India in the establishment of her beneficent
reign?</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence, not all governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed,
for this sublime statement of the Declaration
applies to those only who are fit for self-government.
We hold it now as we always have
held it, a governmental ideal which we mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to realize; for in practice we never have followed
it in our dealings with the Indians, and
we never made a greater mistake than in following
it too literally in the days of “reconstruction”.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be observed that the Philippine
question, coming upon us as it did, all unlooked
for and unsought, made our duty
all the more unmistakable. No time was given
to judge of the capacity of the people for self-government,
nor to ask whether ours was the
nation to assume sovereignty. We were simply
confronted with a situation. The logic of
events (or shall we not say the hand of Providence?)
had placed upon us a responsibility
which, whether desirable or undesirable, we
could not shirk. We stood sponsor to the
world for the islands, the sovereignty over
which we had destroyed. As a question of international
law there could be no doubt of
our sovereignty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But”, says the anti-imperialist, “this is ignoring
the rights of the inhabitants”, and then
he proceeds in academic fashion to solve the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>whole problem by a very simple syllogism,
thus:</p>

<p class='c008'>Major premise—All just government is
founded upon the consent of the governed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Minor premise—The natives of the Philippines
are in need of a just government.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conclusion—The Philippines should be left
to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this pleasant bit of sophistry actually
passes for argument among those who do not
stop to see the gaps in it—who do not reflect
that a government is a growth, and not a mere
artificial structure to be erected by inexperienced
hands—who do not reflect that something
is due to international comity, and that
the nations would certainly have to be reckoned
with in the advent of a new power—and
finally, who will not give candid consideration
to the unanimous testimony of such men as
Schurman, Worcester, Denby, Otis and
Dewey to the effect that “no tie of race, religion,
sympathy or common interest of any
kind holds the natives together or justifies a
belief in their capacity for self-government”!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>But other objections are raised against
American occupation of the Philippines. It is
alleged that it is contrary to our traditional
policy; that it is in disregard of the advice
of Washington to “avoid entangling alliances”;
that it sacrifices our “splendid isolation”,
and makes us more vulnerable to a foreign
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these objections—if objections they are—must
be met by a frank admission. But it
is worth while to inquire into their validity
as objections—to see whether they should
have as much weight henceforth as they have
had in the past; for we must all see very
plainly that the policy of “expansion” involves
a radical change in our world relations—a
change somewhat at variance with our historic
policy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me not be misunderstood when I say
that a certain reserve (to use no stronger term)
has always characterized our government—not
our citizens, mind you, but our government—that
we have exhibited toward the
“Old World” such an attitude as, who should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>say—“We have come out into this New World
to escape the tyranny of the Old. We have
explored it, conquered it, settled it, and then
won our independence from the Old. We
consider our land and its government peculiarly
suited to become the ‘land of the free
and the home of the brave’—‘a home for the
oppressed of all nations’. We intend to stay
at home and not meddle in your affairs, and we
expect you to do the same”.</p>

<p class='c008'>An attitude such as this is just what one
would expect in the light of colonial and revolutionary
history. But there is another—a
politic reason: a weak power with a flattering
prospect of becoming a great one is just
such a prize as would tempt the cupidity of
stronger powers; hence it would desire nothing
so much as to be let alone. Such a power
should above all things “avoid entangling alliances”—keep
to itself until its strength is
developed. Such a power we were when
those words were uttered, and such we remained
as long as the schism of slavery existed,
so that never did we realize our full,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>united strength until called into action against
Spain. Up to the present, then, Washington’s
advice has proved sound policy.</p>

<p class='c008'>What then; are we about to abandon it?
No, but we are about to abandon a perverted
interpretation of it and that, too, not so much
from choice as from necessity. We are beginning
to see that a measure of prudence for
a weak power is by no means equally wise
when that power has grown strong. We are
beginning to see, also, that a false interpretation
of it has somehow become common,
which would confine our activities, save in a
commercial way, to our own boundaries. It
somehow assumes that we are as large and
influential now as we were ever intended to
be; that our future development is to be altogether
internal.</p>

<p class='c008'>To admit the truth of this—to admit that
there is a limit to the area of our country beyond
which it is imprudent to go, to admit
that our country, being a republic, cannot
consistently possess or successfully administer
any foreign territory, whether detached points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of military and commercial importance or portions
of mainland—to admit all this is to admit
the inability of our government to hold its
own with the best. The “government” in
England is no less democratic than the “administration”
in America, and yet England
leads the world in colonization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Expansion in its broadest sense is not
new. It is as old, almost, as the government
itself. We have merely come to
the point of extending its application to
other lands, as England has long been doing,
and that, too, at a time when rapid transit
and communication have simplified the task
inconceivably. The policy of expansion was
in the air in 1893—though it had not yet received
a name—when the weight of public
opinion demanded of our executive that the
Hawaiian Islands should not be restored to
an incompetent queen. Americans have not
yet forgotten their chagrin, nor how European
diplomats laughed at the spectacle of
the “Great Republic”, wanting so much to do
the thing it ought while imagining that its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>hands were tied by the stay-at-home tradition.
This same timidity or reticence or reserve or
self-distrust or self-satisfaction, call it by
whichever term you choose, has already lost
for us the Samoan Islands (save one), Hayti
and other strategic points.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is some gratification to be sure in
being able to show the world, as we have done,
an example of a country which is not grasping
for territory—which can even reject a point of
advantage offered by the inhabitants thereof,
feeling that the sacrifice of territory is better
for us than the sacrifice of the principle of self-government
for them. But in neither Samoa
nor Hayti has the subsequent history of those
places justified our rejection of them, either
for their sake or our own. Moreover as far
as its influence on the world is concerned it
seems to have failed of its effect, if one may
judge by the accusation of avarice that assailed
us at the outbreak of the Spanish war.</p>

<p class='c008'>It took more than the Philippine question,
more than the Spanish war, to inaugurate the
policy of “expansion”. These merely furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the occasion for that toward which the
progress of the world was leading us. To put
it in a word—we have expanded because our
“splendid isolation” is gone, rather than that
our isolation is gone because we have expanded;
and our isolation is gone because of
the progress of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great international factors of to-day,
bringing the nations into common markets
and common councils, pouring the commerce,
news, literature, customs, life, of each into
all the others, are the steamship and the cable.
These have done more for America, probably,
than for any other nation; for more than any
other agency they have destroyed her isolation.
But they have done even more than
that; for they have made her virtually central.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was customary a few years ago—is yet
in some quarters—to speak of the Pacific
Ocean as if it were the backyard of the globe.
It was imagined by one devout geographer
that the hand of an all-wise Providence could
be seen in arranging it so that the most civilized
countries of the earth front upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>same ocean—the Atlantic. But the improvement
of the steamship is equivalent to the reduction
of distance, and this added to the
establishment of bases of traffic virtually narrows
the Pacific down to a smaller ocean than
the Atlantic used to be. Thus America, between
the great manufacturing centers of
Europe and the greatest of markets in Asia,
with the best of pathways to each, seems destined
to become the central market of the
world; and with the Nicaragua canal severing
the Isthmus and the cable crossing the Pacific
her position will be made all the more central
as well as defensible.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a mere matter of policy, why should we
not adopt expansion? Who ever knew a recluse
of a nation to attain to national greatness
of any kind, or to send forth leaders of
men? In such a nation one inevitable result
must be the provincializing and sectionalizing
of men and measures, until breadth of statesmanship
and catholicity of sympathy are unknown.
Americans may well profit by contrasting
the statesmanship of her consuls and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>diplomats abroad with that of certain leaders
at home. The former, accustomed to view the
national policy from without are practically
unanimous so far as they have expressed
themselves in urging that we come out of our
seclusion. “Happily”, says one, “such an
ideal is as impossible as it is ignoble and retrograde.
Impelled by irresistible forces we
are already beginning to look outward, and
are preparing to take the high place among
the nations to which our strength entitles us.
We should be unworthy members of the stout-hearted
race to which we belong if we were
daunted by the dangers and burdens of the
wider activities upon which we are entering”.</p>

<p class='c008'>The matter of greatest concern in the policy
of expansion is, after all, not financial or political
gain, but the reflex influence upon the
individual citizen, and here we can only speculate.
It is alleged on the one hand that expansion
offers opportunities for corruption
such as we never have known in municipal
misgovernment, that it will lodge power in
the hands of officials at a distance from those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to whom they are responsible, that our treatment
of inferior races at home does not justify
our undertaking the same thing abroad, and
that it is downright hypocrisy for us, a democratic
people, to attempt the government of
any other people.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are certain defects common to all of
these objections. It should be noticed, in the
first place, that they seize upon the most conspicuous
features of misgovernment in America
as if they were typical, and consequently
the very thing to be expected in foreign service;
secondly, they indicate a pessimistic distrust
of men—a distrust masquerading as prudence
and conservatism—which is neither
justified by the sum of the facts nor is it
healthful for those who urge them; thirdly,
they assume the equal right of all men to govern
themselves regardless of capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be noticed, moreover, that, as a
rule, officers who receive their positions by appointment
are held more strictly to account
than are those who are elected by ballot; for
the latter are not as apt to be removed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>inefficiency or corruption as the former. Besides
they have the machine back of them instead
of the people or the President. Hence,
since officers for the foreign administrative
service would necessarily be chosen by the
administration, as are those in the consular
and diplomatic service, it is not too much to
expect even a better government for the dependencies
than for ourselves—however
strange it may seem to say so.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be noticed again that good government
is more likely to be the rule than
the exception in our dependencies for the following
reasons:</p>

<p class='c008'>First, oppression, or misgovernment of any
kind, does not pay. As has often been pointed
out, this is the one great lesson that England
learned in the Revolutionary War, and she has
made good use of it ever since. The primary
object, first, last and always, must be the welfare
of the dependency; otherwise it is all a
hypocritical delusion, containing nothing so
good as the seeds of its own destruction. Second,
American pride in what Americans can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>do will not accept any but the best results,
especially when nearly all the world is looking
on distrustfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Third, the one race which by common consent
has best solved the problem of self-government
is the Anglo-Saxon, and the Philippines
are to be congratulated upon being
under its instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be noticed that there are reasons
for believing that instead of having a harmful
influence upon the American commonwealth
the influence of expansion will be healthful.
Corruption in politics is generally a direct result
of the indifference of the citizen, an indifference
arising from an unwarranted sense
of security. The citizen must learn to feel
that he has now an added responsibility, a
deeper obligation to humanity to make his
own government as pure as possible; for the
idea of expansion involves an assumption of
superiority upon our part—an assumption
that we must make good in every particular.
Lynch law and municipal corruption must
cease altogether; for we have given ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to the world as an example not only of good
government, but of good self-government,
and we cannot afford that even occasional exceptions
shall be tolerated. We should have
more politicians, not fewer—so that scoundrels
could find no room in the business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moreover, our newly assumed responsibilities
will have the effect of developing and
training in leadership. It is a most significant
lesson to Americans that this practical training
of leaders and rulers of men has enabled
England, according to some writers, to make
such great advancement in municipal government.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some notice is due to the objection that
these outlying possessions render us more vulnerable
in case of war; that because of their
wide separation and the enormous increase of
coast line the task of defense will be greatly
augmented. This is evidently true; and it is
no less true and no less evident that in the
same ratio will our means of defense be augmented;
for the fighting of the future will be
naval more and more as the years go by; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>naval warfare demands, first, a navy, and, second,
bases of operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a navy is expensive both to create and
to maintain, and our new policy will demand
a largely increased navy and an enormous outlay
of money. Yes, but this has long been
needed by our foreign commerce, and the lack
of it for this purpose has been disastrous. A
nation whose merchants pay out half a million
dollars every day for transportation in foreign
vessels (I quote the words of the chief engineer
of the navy), certainly ought to do all
in its power to encourage its own merchant
marine, at least by furnishing adequate protection.
Think of it! a half a million saved
every day would build a $3,000,000 battleship
in one week. Why, we paid out enough in
pensions in one year to build twenty-five such
vessels. This ought to suggest to every one
that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
of cure”. Hence, though a navy is expensive,
it is still more so to do without one.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, you say, we are incurring a vast expense
in subduing and controlling the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and apparently there is no income to balance
it. Add to all this the $20,000,000 conceded
by the Treaty of Paris, and don’t you
think it a rather poor investment?</p>

<p class='c008'>Here again let us seek our answer from the
experience of England in Egypt and in India.
In both of these countries her outlay of money
originally was enormous, and from neither of
them does she now receive a penny of revenue.
She taxes them to be sure, but the
taxes are spent for the local administration—none
for England. It is from trade with these
countries—the greater because of her greater
prestige—trade which is of mutual benefit, that
England derives any revenue whatsoever, but
that is enormous. Yet she does not forbid
other nations to trade with them nor place
any obstacle in their way. She has had simply
the advantage of greater prestige and
commercial ability.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally one other objection must be noticed
and that is the constitutional objection. As
to the merits of this question, let constitutional
lawyers decide; but if the country has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>expanding ever since it began, and all the
arguments of statesmen, big and little, have
not prevented it from expanding, it would
seem to be not so much a constitutional question
as it is one of national policy and international
law. At any rate the constitution was
made for America and not America for the
constitution; and while it is one of the ablest
of documents, nobody considers it faultless or
supposes it ever could be. James Bryce in
a burst of enthusiasm says of us: “Such a
people could work any constitution”.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to speak in so short a time
of all the points involved in expansion, or
even of the one case we have been considering,
the details of which we can well afford to
omit, if it is justified by political, international,
commercial and especially ethical considerations.</p>

<p class='c008'>We will now listen to questions.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>As soon as the opportunity was given there
were several ready to take advantage of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and the questions came fast and furious—almost.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Professor”, said one, “it seems to me that
I see several inconsistencies in your position.
You will not mind my saying so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly not. Proceed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the first place, you say that a government
is a ‘growth’, and yet you would impose
the authority of our government upon the
Philippines. Why not give their government
a chance to grow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very good; but suppose instead of resulting
in a growth the Philippine attempt proves
abortive, as we have every reason to suppose
that it would? You seem to assume that
growth must result necessarily; but an egg
is more likely to spoil than to hatch when left
without protection, and so it has proved with
republics. The trouble with you theorizers is
that you begin at the wrong end in building
up your Philippine republic. You begin at
the top, the general government, the president
and legislature, instead of beginning at the
bottom, the precinct or township. To be sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the need of a general government is imperative
and immediate, but things never grow in
that way. Now, what do we propose to do
in the Philippines? We propose to substitute
our own power for the general government
while the real government is growing up
among the people. In all self-government life
begins at the extremities, not at the center.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And do you propose to withdraw as soon
as it has attained full growth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We propose to let that question alone until
full growth has been attained. It is quite
unlikely that the American people will ever
care to impose their government upon an unwilling
people who are abundantly able to
take care of themselves. It is much more
likely when that time shall come, that as a
Filipino has expressed it, ‘the Filipinos will be
better Americans than the Americans themselves’,
just like the English colonists in their
loyalty to the mother country”.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is all very well; but I still discover
some assumptions in your answers. In the
first place you assume that the Filipinos are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>incapable of organizing a government for
themselves, and in the second place you assume
that we Americans will be entirely disinterested
in maintaining our authority over
them. If you can satisfy me upon these points
I will accept all you have said.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry I can’t prove everything, and
must therefore make some assumptions”, said
the Professor, “but as to the first I shall simply
refer you to the testimony of those who know
them best, which to me is conclusive upon
this point. But the point itself is secondary
to our international obligation to re-establish
law and order. As to the second assumption,
again I have little to say, though there is much
to be said. I am happy to believe not only
in the general efficiency of our government,
particularly the general or Federal government,
but also in its integrity of character and
the honesty of its administration.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Professor”, said another man, “I suppose
I am what you would call a fanatic; for I am
foolish enough to prefer my own government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>simply because it is mine and not because it
is the best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may be uninformed rather than fanatical,
my friend. Did you ever live any length
of time in Central or South America?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, suppose you go down to Nicaragua,
or Venezuela, or Colombia, or Hayti for four
or five years; then when you come back—that
is if you come back alive—count up the
annual and semi-annual revolutions you have
seen, and then tell us what you think about
it. Don’t you see that you are getting the
sentiment of patriotism and the science of government
somewhat mixed. You may love
your country all you will and independently
of its government, but the only justification
for the latter should be its efficiency—efficiency
in securing life, liberty and justice to
all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to ask a question”, said another
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to know how you would prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>that the Anglo-Saxon is the one race which
by common consent has best solved the problem
of self-government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me refer you for your answer to ‘Anglo-Saxon
Superiority’ by Edward Demolin, a
gifted French writer; also for the influence
of the British and the American constitutions
let me refer you to the history of almost
any legislative body in the world. I think
this last reference in itself is sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems to me, Professor, that your frequent
references to England, especially at
this time, are rather unfortunate, if you will
allow me the liberty to say so; for a country
with so shady a reputation as hers, cannot be
held up for admiration. Will not your advocacy
of expansion suffer from such an unsavory
comparison?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps”, said the Professor, “I may be
pardoned for departing so far from the subject
of the evening as to reply to your criticism,
since it leads up to the answer to your question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has England a ‘shady reputation’? Certainly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>among those who are jealous of her,
and everybody outside of Anglo-Saxon sovereignty
has good reason to be jealous of her.
But is there no better foundation for this reputation
than mere jealousy? Certainly; in
her dealings with Ireland, in the early days in
India, and in her treatment of the American
colonists her policy was sometimes uninformed,
sometimes unwise and even cruel and
oppressive, and her historians offer no defense
for it. Has she displayed unusual cruelty
in her conquests? By no means; she
has displayed such unusual activity in colonization—in
doing police duty for the world, in
substituting intelligent force for misdirected
force, that as a natural result she is disliked
by a great many people. It is not to be supposed
that her purposes in colonization have
always been unselfish—perhaps they never
have been so; but her purposes and methods
in administration are unselfish, and thus she
has taught the world the secret that Rome
failed to find—how to knit together a great
colonial empire.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“You speak of the present unfortunate Transvaal
war. So far as this bears upon your question
I have only this to say; my sympathies
are with the English, because, disregarding
the merits of the original controversy, about
which none of us who read both sides dare
be positive, the English are our own kindred;
and because we could never forgive ourselves
if we were to forget the noble, generous and
fraternal part that England played in 1898,
the consequences of which she is now suffering
in the hostility to the Anglo-Saxon. I do
not dismiss the original controversy because
it is unimportant—for the question of right or
wrong far outweighs all other considerations—but
in the conflict of opinions and the appeals
to passion the American, it seems to me,
should dismiss all; and if he feels that he
must take sides, he will find that the considerations
of race, national interest and national
gratitude, as well as the greater probability of
just government, are all on the side of the
British arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now as to the point of your question:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>England can scarcely be held up to us as a
‘horrible example’ of what is likely to happen
to a nation which allows itself to expand, because
at the very worst the example isn’t sufficiently
horrible. But more than that, our
acquisitions have all come to us peacefully and
gladly, except one fifth of the Filipinos,
and our whole course has been singularly devoid
of mistakes, and I can imagine that in
the future this period, safely passed, will be
regarded as one of the most brilliant and successful
in our history.”</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>EXPLANATION OF PRECEDING TABLE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Whenever a sign of any kind appears in the preceding synopsis
it means that there is a proviso in our treaty with that
country touching more or less definitely upon the subject
indicated. The sign (†) means that the subject is covered
by the proviso or nearly so; a (‡) means that it is modified
in some measure; a (§) means that it applies only to American
citizens in the consular service, not to foreigners, and
a (¶) means that the requisitions for the extradition of criminals
may be made “through the superior consular officer;
otherwise through the diplomatic service.” A blank space
means that the point is not touched upon by any treaty
now in force.</p>

<p class='c008'>This synopsis of our commercial treaties shows at a glance
their relative fullness or deficiency, and the most remarkable
thing about it is their deficiency. Sometimes, it is true, by
virtue of international comity, much larger discretion is exercised
by consuls and diplomats than is vouchsafed by the
terms of the treaty; but it is not to be inferred that this is
always the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Treaties are sometimes intended to last forever (<i>in perpetuo</i>),
and sometimes they are concluded for only a term
of years. Political treaties, the purposes of which is usually
to terminate wars, establish boundaries, award indemnities,
etc., naturally belong, as a rule, to the first class, while
commercial treaties usually have a time limit. This accounts
for a good many of the blank spaces in the above
synopsis.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be noticed that there are some countries in the
above list which have not at present the treaty making
power—such, for instance, as Egypt, the Hanseatic Republic,
Prussia, Hawaii, Samoa, Madagascar, Borneo, Kongo Free
State, etc. In such cases the government which assumes
the sovereignty assumes the treaty obligations, or else concludes
new ones.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>It may be noticed, on the other hand, that there are no
commercial treaties with either Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay or
Chile. This does not mean that there are no political treaties
with those countries, or that there never have been any commercial
treaties, but merely that in some cases the latter
have been allowed to lapse or have been abrogated, and
no new ones have been concluded. Canada, Australia, India,
and all other colonies have no sovereignty, and therefore are
not states in international law. Hence they cannot appoint
or receive ambassadors nor can they make treaties except
through the sovereign power.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
